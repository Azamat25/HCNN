ok ok i get the idea looking at the source for the page is easiest does anyone else find watching paint dry or discussions about html come to that more interesting than motor sports
hillyi take your earlier point buti would like to support any new runners that take up the flm challenge in june i had a kidney removed following years of serious illness i had never ran races before but months later i completed the flm in hours not fast i know but i did not find it that hard really and i enjoyed every minute and raised pounds for charity i have a golden bond again to do it this year providing you put in sensible training and respect the distance i really believe anyone can do it good luck to everyone
my body seems to be telling me to take it easy this week too not sure why this has n t happened before but this week i ve been spectactularly exhasted for no apparent reason i have been out times already but normally can cope with that wanting to up my training a bit and was planning to go out this afternoon do n t know what to do now i m not injured just sleepy should i go
did not im a speed reader unlike my running marvellous quote tho wonder if the ward will have any spare daily mails i could make a scrapbook of the trials and tribulations
i ran reading half yesterday and was really pleased with my time and thought generally it was well organised however what did disappoint me aside from teh min delay was the number of slower runners that started at the front despite there being markers to indicate times i have to admit that i was in the box ahead of where i should have been but one comment i heard was ooh it says sub perhaps we should move back the reply was no it will take us ages to cross the line i finished in officially but it still took me minutes to cross the line so my actual time was and for the entire race i continually overtook people i was glad i didnt start further back with the sub where i should have been but if it had been managed properly then you wouldnt get people trying to start in a higher ability group and slow down those behind them who are in the correct group
hi taz i hope the new physio instills more confidence in you it can be an expensive trial trying to find one you feel happy with and who is effective and i am eternally grateful to my colleague who recommended her i ca n t believe how different i feel about it all now as to last week i have n t run yet next run is tomorrow but shall carry on spending as much time as i can with my legs up to prevent further problems believe me i am so impressed with the results and feel confident that things will come right in the end but i am going to be super dooper careful from here on in i hope you get some good news or at least feel happy with what is diagnosed tonight let us know how you get on
hmmm for me how about a competition to see who gets a time closest to their race number like for number
we enjoyed supporting can t blooming speak now tho

malt i used last year s schedule but for the prague marathon and this year s schedule for flm both times i followed them to the letter and both times had really bad runs i did prague in and flm in but under easier conditions previously i had never done a marathon in more than hours and had never thought i would i do n t know if it s the schedules or if i am just getting too old or what the problem is but i m a sucker for someone else telling me what to do and will probably follow next year s schedule as well whatever it turns out to be

brilliant day even though i hate running in the rain but the crowd support was excellent ended up mins slower than i wanted wanted a h finished in h but i forgive myself that with a lack of training and that rain as my excuse pb was ian duncan smith running when you saw him because the only time i saw him was at the blue start surely he should have been at green wearing a suit and shoes looked to me like he was dropping out the urwfrc point at mudchute was great even though i nearly missed it how could flora put a water station there of all places the only celeb i saw running was the back of bobby charlton in front of me at about mile i m hoping i beat him but probably did n t anyway well done to you all
first marathon trained for started in middle of pen got chip time felt no probs at start but st miles were v frustrating lots of stopping and starting due to bunching so many people just changing course made things difficult the few that gave hand signals not that sort of hand signal made it easier great day great support feel that i want to try and get that before i get much older

one for beav and jonah a man walks into a bar with a dachshund under his arm the dog is wearing a man city shirt bobble hat and scarf the barman says hey no pets allowed in here you ll have to leave the man begs look i m desperate we re both big fans my tv is broken and this is the only place we can see the game against united after securing a promise that the dog will behave and warning that if there is any trouble they will be thrown out the barman relents and allows them to stay in the bar and watch the game city attack from the kick off and their first goal attempt is cleared off the line for a corner with that the dog jumps up on the bar and begins walking up and down the bar giving everyone a high five the barman says wow that is the most amazing thing i ve ever seen what does the dog do if they score a goal i do n t know replies the owner i ve only had him for four years

ouch pw that is sore mine is nearly recovered now but it was only overstretched i think not torn luckily your martial arts training will help you block out some of the pain just hope you dont do any more damage though glad you are able to do some training though though
i like pearce s post match comments to say i am disappointed would be one of the biggest understatements of all time if i was a supporter i would be disgusted with that performance i know i am as a manager we showed no moral courage whatsoever i do not include the goalkeeper in this but the rest of them i have told to go home have a look at their kids and ask them how daddy did today none of them stepped up to the plate none of them showed any leadership none of them earned their wages without doubt it was the worst experience i have had as a manager i have been in bad teams during my career but i would like to think somewhere down the line if i was n t playing well i had the bottle to receive the ball i had the bottle to get in someone s face and i had the bottle to get aggressive with someone show my aggression out on the pitch and show i was not happy our players did not do that today i am not passing the responsibility onto the players the buck stops with me but if i have to do something about it to be a successful manager i will these boys have to come back into work again they have to walk past me in the corridor and look me in the eye they know exactly how i feel about them at this present moment in time it was unacceptable and if it happens again there will be people leaving this club
mrs t first serious attempt at the distance time as gr said ca n t be a confident unsure of my mp endurance the furthest i have gone is miles mp my race tactics will be to get miles in and then hang on for dear life is this a good plan

hi fiona just catching up with the thread sorry to hear the news i m dedicating my run to my father in law and a close friend both of whom died from cancer my father in law also had a series of strokes major ones so that s where i ll be getting my inspiration from at around miles i ll most likely be walking like him at that stage as well sorry that may sound sick but we had some lively banter going on between the two of us when he was alive he was paralysed down the left hand side but he always made a joke about it and i used to take the mick out of him in return got us both laughing and he ll be watching me on the day and giving it back with interest
buena fortuna mokina have a good week end everyone and steady on the easter eggs

morning t map jej mrs t dan a ndo w cy blisters oo rb congratulations and commiserations great reports ndo i hope you are all right hours for me h at half way and just on time by miles but i had very tight hamstrings which were cramping up so i slowed to a pace that allowed me to get to the finish without stopping i have mixed feelings this morning the marathon is such an unnatural distance to run anyway it s great to be able to listen to your thoughts about the race and the banter and support on this thread has been fantastic this year people at work who have n t got a clue are already annoying me with their advice and anecdotes all the best and recover well no running for me till saturday and i have mayo on my sarnies at lunch today i agree with dan a tapering is over rated
i said to my boyfriend the other day the nicest people that you will ever come across are runners and vegetarians i am both i am happy for you shona i can understand how devastated you were
bet i hold the record i took six on sunday morning before the start i know it was a really stupid thing to do but had the runs from wednesday night until saturday morning lived on a diet of jam sandwiches pints of watered down lucozade sport per day though little stayed inside this was my third flm i figured that even if i had to walk most of it as long as i could stay bunged up i could complete and justifiably collect my sponsorship money as it turned out they worked a treat i managed which was about half an hour slower than i targeted before my illness i was also back to normal service by tuesday morning however i would never advise anybody to run a marathon whilst ill it was the most physically painful thing i have ever done
hippo im with you belfast today and still failed to break must be getting old finished in some secs slower great new course hilly tough first half adn flat second this has potential
thanks diana we re not off til next wednesday you ve got to put up with me for another week yet

thanks mike this will be a new stage for me as all those sessions have me running further than the race distance i m pacing at oooer i m always up for a challenge though
doing only s and with mins recovery seemed like a real doddle compared with the with far less recovery even though the pace was faster actually managed secs lap faster than my last x supposedly at k pace sessions so i m pretty satisfied with that
mokina glad you are settling down in dublin have n t got the foggiest how much euros is but it sounds cheap so yaaaaaaay lol and its not that you are getting older you know its prohably cos the goal has gone for the time being now that you have pulled out of your marathon you need another one to aim for enjoy your shopping slugsta tracey bradley is a star although we do argue like cat and dog at times my older son laughs at us when he is around he thinks we are so alike which is why we argue probably right if i think i am right i do n t let go and neither does bradley i have a very tight calf muscle this morning its quite painful and i am still knackered i need an early night really but i have arranged to go out to dinner this evening at one of my old assistant manager s he got married about a month or so ago and i could n t get there his wife used to work for me too so i need to go and see them champers again its such a hard life is n t it
quote dana will start the bidding on predicted times between me and pug over the next few days oh dear this ll be interesting i m having reservations the way i m feeling lately this tapering is horrible just feel like a fat slug now you want odd pb s check mine out k mile k mile marathon marathon bear that in mind when you do ya predictions hahaha pug
oh cath poor you get back down the quacks i know how pants you feel when you ca n t train i was like a while back was n t i with that virus that turned into migrane clusters i did n t listen to my body either and tried to train try to take it easy untill ya fully recoverd lecture over but i hope your feelin better soon big hugs pinks i do m sprints at on the tredmill and m recovery at on the running machine my next trick is to set the incline at after downloading that tredmill programme the bloke was saying that by settin it at that your forcing the hamstrings to do what they natrally do out on the road but if its flat then the muscles do n t work as they should and tremill does it all for you some thing like that any way i m sure you can word it better rio
missed your last post but you can pick up some fab costume accessories these days from the high street next m s debenhams top shop etc you do n t need to spend much or go searching far off the high street i ve had some nice cheap bling from sainsburys even
pug why bother with a slow plod around luton might as well go for a sub and see what happens you could always drop out after or laps if it s not going well that s what i did last year back to back sub s are very possible rb did it at paris london this year and someone else finally managed it at cardiff ny plus sub will probably get you into the top i m currently crippled with a mystery knee injury so taking a fortnight completely off for the first time in about years to recover might go up to watch luton if i can be arsed to get up early i know a few guys who are running plus it will be good to see a winning performance from the jock
pops head in hi guys long time no see thanks to cg for the email kick up the bum to get me back on this thread nothing wrong just been really busy lol but not too busy to train miles so far in i m in work this is a bit naughty proper update later i promise thanks again for the email cg
only the semis sadly dodgy refereeing and italian gamesmanship versus ac milan denied us the chance of a trip to wembley where we surely would ve become the first british team to lift the trophy charlie cooke ian ure alan gilzean the arabs across the road united were up from the home leg v roma but lost away in the year grobelaar had his wobbly legs we did also lose narrowly to the mighty leeds united side of in the then fairs cup semi final we had joy we had fun we had seasons in the sun sun
thought i would try out these u lovely u buttons
toasty you re a model for many to follow my valentine s day post work has been spent running miles pace round hyde park with my wee boy followed by a low cal ham sandwich and grapes from m s for me chicken pasta salad and a brownie for him on the long tube journey home classy or what sciatica very painful now of course
whats your precious
i had an adventure on sunday as i planned to run about and ended up running due to getting lost on kingley vale it was completely my fault but the mist and heavy rain plus mud did not help i did a speed session monday rested tuesday with just a couple of sets of tennis i can still feel the effects of sunday now with a slight ankle twist and sore left knee but this is still minor on the pain scale i do plyometrics hopping helps to strengthen the ankle and i have exercises for my knee which ease the pain this has worked well over several months my plan of sticking to hours went out the window on sunday as i was out for hours minutes still good time on your feet i will go back to hours on sunday and run a miler on thursday i am still learning what best suits me as stacks of month injuries have meant constant disappointment however the last months has been good i do minutes static stretches after running and now do plometrics times a week to try and keep the injuries minimal and hopefully away i am trying isotonic drinks tauts cranberry and blackberry after long runs to try and rehydrate and recover more quickly i started on sunday and this seems to help me recover quicker also glucosamine and chondroitin helps keep the joints supple and flexible at least thats what i hope i also have changed from icing injuries which never seemed to work for me causing soft tissue damage if kept on too long too nurofen gel which seems to help minor injuries recover more quickle i am still looking forward to the marathon and hoping for a good time i will aim for but will most probably end up with to the last k is the killer
i dont think you can defer a club place joe but its still worth asking
first half marathon so is a pb but not a lot to beat have done longer runs but they are just trainign runs really getting into the races now
desert man and i was going to complain about the icy wind this morning half mile reps at everything between m m very encouraging and m m very depressing could still feel last week s heavy mileage in the legs but not a bad session all in in terms of sw s point yes the marathon is a bit of a gamble but after of the little b gg rs i m starting to get a better idea about my strengths and weaknesses and i can compare race times with last year for instance i ran off a half no taper if i can get back down to or even a bit lower should be on the cards interestingly although i d always thought that i was more of an endurance person than a speed person my k time is actually my fastest as an age graded percentage but that may be because some girl called paula keeps on running marathons relatively fast compared to half marathons
after missing much of last week due to shooting pains in calf i managed on saturday with reps of miles supposed to be but i was being sensible and hrs mins yesterday last hour was a struggle with my calf the same as last sunday hoping that if i can survive the next weeks the tapering will allow the calf time to recover enough for me to get around flm all the these niggles have rather dampened my focus on sub and instead i am looking at finishing being a real goal yeterdays run slightly ruined by one of the guys telling us towards the end that his watch made our run less than we thought there again his story earlier in the run about his wife and a pig more than made up for it
i wore mine at reading and got a pb personally i believe them to be magic go faster laces and wo n t hear another word against them
jj i thank the lord that rugby and tri seasons do n t clash xtrrea finishs rwc starts bliss hope wasps they need to be beaten in the final

dave the metcheck thing s hysterical my metcheck page refreshed etc for the day is totally diff to yours says degrees sunny partly cloudy re meeting times spose i was thinking i d get there earlier than but go to loo sort self out dump bag get coffee etc then meet everyone else then there s a bit of time to chat chill dash into the bushes because the loo queues are too long etc etc

i do get tunnel vision but generally only around westferry and blackfriars
only you can say if i behaved or not or maybe your oh or kids if my oh gave me a freezer for christmas he would be permanently attached to it for a long long time time
morning all well done everyone bit of a strange one for me my quads seemed to give up on me after miles could n t believe it i set off slower think i got everything right in the build up kept my fluid levels topped up but obviously something not right i think if i d have cramped up after for going off too fast i would ve been disappointed with myself cos it happened so early in the race after a mile or so of muttering expletives under my breath i managed to see the funny side of it although the prospect of running another m with what felt like two dead legs was n t an appealing one anyway i shimmied along at whatever pace the legs would let me and finished in in the end which surprised me as i thought i was heading for hrs after realising it was n t my day i made the most of it and took everything in stopped to see some friends and was completely blown away by the support tower bridge and along the dual carriageway were awesome it s impossible not to smile heading down the last m can t really get my head round what went wrong and i m not gonna beat myself up about it as it was the experience of a lifetime but i feel like i ve got a little unfinished business with london now great effort again all matttherat darren larder rowan chieftain tank ttt po banksie roundhay mike valuxian aa rain bow smiffie rfj ruscr
bw there s no rest for the wicked then you re straight into the next challenge there s no stopping you just how much punishment can you fit into one month no seriously good look and yes you do need your head testing gc enjoy the rest you ve never earned it more than now so take it while you can before you have to put in the hard work again that will come all too soon euph thanks for the york k entry form i ll send it off today i entered it last year but did n t run due to foot injury also sending entry off for wheldrake k and hope to get a place with you and beders on that i think nickm is doing that too i ll text you if able to come across on sunday the weather sounds perfect for marathoners i shall bring my brolly good luck tonight in your club race you ll still be flying along even when you re taking it easy clairster keep those feet and legs rested in time for saturday you ll be fine you know the drill make sure you text me let me know how you get on hey ceal that s just blxxdy fantastic you go girl there s a guy from our club who also runs the masters usually the m m he s a mv so only just turned vet last year he got a bronze at the world masters indoor champs in poland hope you ll be coming away with a medal too i m excited for you looking at that gb flag next to your name must be a great feeling last night we did a hilly muddy off road mile run which was great it certainly made me puff and blow to start with but the scenery was good and it was a nice change so a bit better than doing a lung buster on the roads today is a rest day as the league race is tomorrow night a mile undulating course i actually feel a bit better so it s probably just what i need i ve also invested in a pair of paula socks knee high flight socks to help my tibial muscle which is still very sore not that they look very trendy but if they do the job then i m not bothered some of the men commented on them last night but they did n t fancy wearing the spare pair for some reason physio thinks i will need a small orthotic to help the muscle repair itself without stopping me running so going back for fitting next week

the pugometer was introduced as a term for gauging performance in a race i personally do not use a pre callibrated pugometer eg i ran at flm but the pugometer rated my performance as because the weather was quite warm the pugometer has nothing to do with ranking all runners on this thread as shite ps seen someone s starting up another thread
daz that s brilliant i m sure as a family you will do very well and it s something for you guys to share vb pinks do n t be too jealous i still have to go back daz you really must run flm again next year andrew i ran it for dreams come true this year and will enter the ballot again this year but do n t intend to run for charity unless someone else wants to organise it for me there s only so many times you can ask family and friends for money and remain popular

morning all fotd miles went ok on a hilly course reckon that there were about ft of climbs in total so not bad key for me now is to keep it up and with all respect to the bangles run like a very fast egyptian panicking weeks from now i ll be lining up at margate by my reckoning this post will go in at i d better have completed it weeks hours and minutes from when this post goes in or else
just checking in miles last week with a mile tempo run of minutes into a gale felt hard nothing this week so far was working abroad yesterday and with impeccable timing got ill monday night no sleep and multiple bathroom visits crawled home from hrow yesterday to find rest of family laid up with same rowan that does really sound like a lot of money fwiw i also vote for a second opinion rfj thats an excellent idea i find it so much easier with the discipline of a plan to work around my application for the ballot also went off at the weekend cheers nick
nice one guys two new pb s both with uphill bits i m still looking for the sub myself ls as you say it s getting closer and is n t it nice to get that elusive sub batw not sure if i ll ever get faster but as least it s done no running today day off after days on the trot so looking forward to a fell run tomorrow me thinks maybe even in the sun a bit quiet again in the holiday season see ya lata cheers beders
i must be one of those strange people who now weighs a bit less than they did for flm about lbs here s what i look like with a bmi of a whopping and a bleeding nipple i might ve featured in some of ww s pics had he not left me for dust to finish his mins last k dash
tt nf is still on we go there lots as a family so i d like to run there but i ll take it as a run and enjoy it i m no longer in a rush to get race fit as fast as possible there will be no more or peaks run in preparation for it though and if the hills are a struggle then wtf i do n t really care i ve another couple of other race entries that i ve previously paid for too but again i ll just treat then as extra runs and enjoy them my knee and my aerobic base fitness will hopefully benefit in the long run
yes there do seem to be alot of b days around this time
i once had a customer tell me all about the marathon his mum did turned out it was a race for life
good news re mini wabbs my cheque still not cashed so not in for me well done didds and corredor although i may still have club place option as in this year quads achy after circuits and yesterday s run but in a weird way quite like it off for torture miles tonight with club where i am always at back back
wtgy i would n t run speedwork by hr although it can be useful to look at the stats afterwards e g to see how well hr is falling off over different recovery times etc recovery runs and long runs i aim to stay lt max with other stuff it depends what the purpose of the run is e g a complete run at marathon pace something approx to your wednesday run might be around max or a tempo run around with warm up and cool down fwiw max i ve seen for races have typically been mara hm k although that all went out of the window with my last hm where i averaged hr same as my last k i think i ve found hr useful to keep an eye on for trying to keep a steady pace but without relying on keeping to some pre planned level i like to think i pay less attention to it as i get better pacing by perceived effort gobi at bushy tt whatever i predict you always tonk it anyway so i may as well make it a little stiffer for you this time padams as long as it s or slower philpub mtr gobi sods law it will be windy and wet sorry to be anal mtr but for consistency i ve removed your colon fnick fnick
no just from highams park was miles only back up to k at the minute yes just read about paula inspirational my brother he was on the bus with us flm morning ran his first dublin marathon last monday hrs dead fab time for him
is n t the gnr flatter
i followed the advanced marathoning week up to mile schedule in and improved my flm pb from to in i did the week up to mile schedule and did this year i m planning on doing the same as with two changes i m going to try and run the last miles of my long runs at marathon pace to try and improve my ability to maintain speed towards the end of a race and i m going to do tempo runs instead of track work i m aiming to go sub which i reckon i would have been pretty close to last year if it had n t been so hot i ve found the above schedules easy to follow they are almost two easy in that very few of the sessions are high intensity and i always panic that i m not doing enough however come the big day they have the desired effect if i get a sub i m going to jack in the training and run my last marathon in off the elite start dressed in a huge scooby doo outfit that should guarantee me a slot on the telly
i ve found that one of the best things about keeping notes is that they stop me worrying that i m not doing enough i m running extra miles per week compared with last year but generally feeling a lot less tired and i do n t have to rest all afternoon after an mile run mile club run at min mile last night
morning all feeling very tired this morning running a half marathon followed by a party involving several glasses of wine not a good combination however buoyed by yesterday s success i have just entered another half in march as it lines up with distance for lsr on the same day so although course a bit hillier hoping i will have gained a bit more fitness by then although i have a miler the previous week so maybe not tutu still a great time i was looking at the results trying to work out which was yours were there any team prizes at the awards ceremony wore my skins to bed last night so the legs feel ok just the general tiredness slight hangover that is not so good thankfully hangoiver not as bad as feared after three large glasses of wine dtb great to hear the pat strap thing works hrr good to hear you re back on top form really must get some work done ca n t procrastinate any longer
can you believe that our charity the blue cross have placed themselves up flights of stairs yikes after a long run i love a glass of cold milk and some hazelnuts hope they have some as a reward for dragging myself up there
i m back and i m stinkin but i ve got miles under my belt more news after my shower
i hope you will all take responsibility for my letting go so beautifully as you advised and now have eaten my way through two snowballs a fry up chicken curryand rice fish an dchips oh and stewed apple yogurt and honey heeeeellllp
does n t look like it but i m sure there are lots btw i m running for children with leukaemia they have hundreds of runners but not a single thread here in the forum
wow what a lot of soft mush you lot talk tutu have you ever considered that if you stand at the starting line it may be because you are slightly bonkers and those that did n t get there may be the sensible ones susan have a good rest you deserve it after your almost long run run
oh dear hana i really do sympathize i have been absolutely unbearable for the whole of this month and will no doubt be the same until i get to the start line either this year or when i am pain free i think its possible but then when i try to work out the remaining days and what to do i start to think it is increasingly unlikely that i will start the race mrs puffy had to defer once and there is simply nothing to be said or done it is thoroughly miserable and frustrating and anyone that tries to cheer you up just has n t a clue it must be even worse as you read about people doing their last runs and beginning the taper i reckon its got to be up there with a major accident or losing your job just do n t send the form in till you have too and do it special delivery delivery
bizkit i think we are getting a wee bit nervous and excitable hana s fault we shall calm down now now
i put this on the macmillan runners thread last year now i lay me down to sleep i pray the lord my health to keep if i should panic before i wake i pray the lord my fear to take god bless barley beanz all group runners supporters and runners from the other groups the mad lady from group one celebrating her th on race day btw i am not particularly religious i just like this
gatton do you work for argos i used to work for them the branch in kingston upon thames it s gone downhill massively since i worked there though obviously cause i left but maybe other reasons like halving the shop in size for example anyway just popping into this thread to give my details for the support group forum name annajo name suggest you email this if unhappy to divulge via the forum anna race number estimated time to mile somewhere between hours aiming for a sub what you ll be wearing green macmillan vest with anna on the front over a t shirt probably black long sleeve and black leggings any special needs tell me how great i m looking even though i ll be looking knackered apart from that i should be ok i m carrying the equivalent of the kitchen sink with me me

didds having said that a sub at abingdon is quite appealing umbongo slaps himself round the face for having such silly ideas my targets for the rest of the year are sub half sub k and then as close to mins as i can i have my first club k next week which will be my marker and then they do one in july and one in august the july one will be my sub min race and the august will be to get as close to mins as possible i am down to do windsor half in sept the same day as new forest half i am booked in for my london to oxford bike ride in july may see wabo there or not i read the rw article on lance armstrong and quite like the idea of combining cycling into my running training blah blah blah
th july i am free now dave do not knock this off
brian great racing sounds like you re going well coro i keep intending to do something at a watford open meeting but never get round to it a k might be interesting let me know if you decide to do one and i ll try to come along
cg that s a big big lr for a hot day very tough good run joolska too you will fly when it cools down prob for the rest of the summer summer
a lot can change in a week having bailed attempts at a m pmp run last week i nailed one last night to the point that it became a long tempo run rather than pmp m in mm pace was half tempted to carry on to try to log an unofficial hm pb as this is s per mile inside my current hm pb pace and was still feeling strong ave hr very pleased not sure what was different i am transistioning into new trainers at the moment most of last weeks running was on old ones with c m on them so extra cushioning may have helped but i think the biggest difference was just generally feeling up for it and wanting to get things back on the right track the other factor may be that i had had about weeks running mostly off road hilly routes culminating in borrowdale leading upto last week s training so have had to readjust to running faster on the flat again anyway feeling more positive again so i ll enjoy it while it lasts steady m this morning and hoping to squeeze in a cheeky visit to the track on the way home tonight which would make for a rare double cg get well soon and do n t try to fight it i had days off with some sort of lurgy man flu in march it was right at the time my training for flm should have been peaking but i just did n t feel like running so i did n t was also v busy at work at the time i m sure i limited the damage by resting rather than trying to run through it
yep ady yogs is def running with a ballot place well done fp another bod to cheer along the mall err sorry lads not doing beachy like i said earlier too much carp in my life ticking along with about runs a week at the moment just to keep a very low level of fitness and it clears my head a bit from all the rubbish that sswfw puts in it x
you know how i always advise folks to run lots of ks still no pug
great race report tutu sounds like fun might have to give it a go sometime as for guy fawkes i did n t do it i ve not run more than miles yet since hurting my back so i decided togive the race a miss ended up at the metro centre all day looking at prams and other baby stuff instead got out for miles last night really slow and i ve not yet recovered my ability to run up hills as i had to stop a couple of times on the really steep one close to home i know that when i can run up it without stopping then i m back to full fitness it an early bonfire party tonight with fireworks etc no idea why it s done a day early in bishop auckland but it is so it cross training in the gym at lunchtime with a couple of miles on the treadmill ozy ozy
was n t that shake n vac
i m backing off a bit this week after last week s big week niggles are niggly especially yesterday when i had to drive to maidenhead and back for a meeting worse for my legs than anything else struggled through a recovery run in the late afternoon rice last night and my legs are a lot better but i do n t have the work window today to do the planned mile run lunchtime and evening meetings so i ll fit in a mile run at some point in the day work is going to be very hectic in the next few months as the charity i run is merging with another larger one loads of meetings documents due diligence lawyers accountants etc etc ontop of my normal job should all settle down by the end of april thus potentially ruining my whole training plan for london we ll see welcome mp there s some good stuff in this thread but a lot of other stuff to plough through to get to it hours might be optimistic by my calculations that s about posts a minute to read marigold nice to hear you re reentering the land of the living i reckon i ve been virus free for days now which might be a record for the last months months
i think all the quick treadmill running is definitely an indication of frustration of plodding through snow if it goes ahead i think conditions wise wokingham will be the complete opposite of last year it was as close to perfect conditions as i think i have run in oh well pbs all round and claim an extra min or on the old pugometer
sue c wrote mm you know an awful lot about cycling do you have a background in the sport yes i still consider myself a cyclist even though i do more running these days than cycling i got into cycling years ago through the excitement of the best tour de france ever won by greg lemond and have followed it ever since done a fair bit of racing but time constraints since my daughter was born have caused me to take up running to keep fit bizarrely doing marathon training is easier timewise with a family than trying to train for time trials or road races caterpillar girl v jealous of the fact you ve got your x longest runs done already i ve got another lsr planned tomorrow weather permitting but i m building up over the next weeks to get them all in rather than getting them done early on pmp i m with xps on this one i try and fit in x pmp pace run of an hour every two weeks to practice running at target pace but my take on it is that you should do varied runs throughout the week to work on all aspects of your fitness lsr pmp intervals to develop your vo max recovery runs the only thing missing at present in my weekly schedule is a medium length run of miles but this is something i am planning on introducing to increase my miles shortly
a lot of thought has to go into my signs do you know how many clip art pictures there are out there
i think those who dont put on weight should take some of the rest of our weight as they burn it off easier anyone watching london let us all know where you ll be so you can cheer us if its still light by the time i get past
he s right though emily it s really tough when you want to do it but better in the long run to miss it than to get properly injured yes a swim later might be good as then you have n t got the pounding i know how you re feeling
i m back from my fab weekend in carlise lovely country house hotel too much food and drink and no running at all will have to get back to it tomorrow watched the boys play rugby in sleet and gusting wind was totally drenched and freezing cold afterwards but good games got back to hotel for lovely hot bubbly bath and a bottle of champagne ah it sounds like the exams went well hope you hear soon as the waiting is often harder than the exam what are longest lsrs that people have planned i thought i read that someone was planning and is anyone going over
morning everyone heading off on my miler not sure if i should go the roads or the old railway line railway line is traffic free hate trying to make decisions when i m sleepy

pizzaman cheers for the encouraging words i did my half marathon in and ran flm that year with an injured friend which meant finishing in to make sure the slacker finished i m keen to see what i can do at the fleet half since i ran a km pb three weeks ago and training has been going well since then i take your point about the pacers i ll try and use them as a ceiling for a finish a further concern is that i think i ll be in the pen at the start and it might be a bit of a battle to find my way to the pacer god its going to be a fun day assuming i get there ok the bat
well the mind is a powerful healing tool
lol monique monique
not worth throwing it all away but certainly not worth serious or permanent injury if the pain is still there after a few days rest then think seriously about giving this year a miss and defer to next year have had to do this myself for this year disappointed but having done the race years ago it s not just a case of only another at the end they were the hardest miles i think i have ever done better to be running in next years race than not being able to run at all sorry about the doom and gloom outlook my brother had an knee injury a few years back and decided to do a race anyway he now watches me from the side as he really knackered his knee up if the body says it hurts do n t do it
wolfy i was looking on trianline but i ll try virgin and gner
and when it s finished you might throw up sorry that the sort of thing i should have kept to myself

st giles hotel arround the mark for a very nice room with sports facilities tottenham court road tube station station
only weeks to go well minus christmas weeks cos no one runs then so thats then there s the taper three weeks before so oh and of course you ll have a couple of colds over that time which take a week or so to get over so ah but then there s a chance you ll have a birthday between now and then so thats a saturday night out on the beer and you do n t want to be running with a hangover so ah and of course there s injuries bound to have one in that time which take at least weeks to get over so ah forgot new years eve which leaves you with a hang over for at least a week oh and of course there s all those sunday mornings when you really ca n t be bothered to get out of the bed because its raining oh and the wedding aniversary and wifes birthday both of which you are expected to bring her breakfast in bed and take her out for the day so that leaves weeks then there s all the d i y jobs she expects you to do on sundays that you have n t done because of all the hangovers birthdays and bad weather so that leaves us with one week to train hmmmmm think i ll defer till next year

i think i might go for a swim on saturday morning really gentle thanks for the exercise skeezix i will have a hot bath and a stretch tonight someone at my club suggested it might have just knotted up when i started tapering fingers crossed carbo loading i am slowly increasing the carbs but trying to take on some protein as well to help with the healing lots of tuna and mackeral i am trying to take on enough water as well but do feel a bit dehydrated so moving on to energy drinks from tomorrow tomorrow
bad luck adam find a good physio mine suggested it was my greater trochanter muscle and lower back and hip joint inflammation she gave ultrasound tens machine type thing back hip massage and loads of stretches and core stability exercises weeks of no running just swimming and physio sessions sorted it out completely anyway you could n t have done miles without training at least hold on to that you d have done a great half marathon what about the loch ness marathon my sister helped to organise it last year then ran it and it sounded great i did n t meet up with anyone beforehand as i was sprinting across the field to the loo that was before i knew there was a half hour wait
good idea it s a lovely day i m going for a long walk thanks everyone
oooh jpvd you re sooooo keen miles easy for me today so prob i wo n t be joining you have a nice sunny nostalgic run though can t remember where womble but i definitely got a push as you went past me i m assuming you re the guilty womble as we ran a similar time do n t worry i wo n t be seeking revenge much
hi monique which ironman are you doing i did my third run last night after the marathon a club miler legs still heavy i think on the back of my current fitness i m going to do another half marathon on may and then possibly another marathon on june in devon i m determined to try and run a more tactical marathon and not start off doing miles my only difficulty now is a training schedule post marathon i m not sure when to start doing speed and harder sessions
surely so it s still cool and quite remarkable nice one daniel
hi all fairly quiet on the thread at the moment like i have been myself a bit really ran home from work last night usual mile route which was quite enjoyable as it had stopped raining by then and was warm i ve realised that some days you just feel good like you re flying along like ashley and some days it s just not going to happen and i ve had quite a few of those lately weeks ago i had a good day and finished the same route over mins quicker even by not even really trying so i think your body has natural ebbs and flows of energy it s just getting it right tonight i m back at the club and we have planned a recce run of the last k inter club league race which is a week today this should be fun as it s got some sharp hills in it apparently just hope i can hang onto the mens pack tomorrow i will probably run a miler from work then saturday is rest day and sunday is track field training seems to be all over at the moment due to various races and leagues but will get it right i m thinking of doing newark half marathon on th august instead of darlington k which i had planned has anyone run this before or know anything about it hope you are all flying and looking forward to the weekend races if you have anything planned cheers sarah
very interesting smashy i m amazed that you think the course conditions could make minutes of difference assuming paula is in shape given perfect conditions it must be an absolute stinker of a course and poor tracey morris if it does end up taking her hope she has some people to run with at that pace or it might be quite a lonely race for her
this sounds fantastic dips would you say it is better to go on one of the earlier camps in january in order to get all the principles in earlier or is it best to sign up for late feb when i ve built up a bit more endurance

jaq just started thinking of hotels saw your post checked website hotel looks good price as yours so i m booked in london marathon contingent of two at the comfort inn any others
the initial objectives of the london marathon as set out by chris brasher to improve the overall standard and status of british marathon running by providing a fast course and strong international competition to show to mankind that on occasions the family of man can be united to raise money for the provision of recreational facilities in london to help london tourism to prove that when it comes to organizing major events britain is best to have fun and provide some happiness and sense of achievement in a troubled world flm does not and never did exist solely to raise money for charity but on the other hand charitable objectives were there from the start i still believe that all these objectives can be part of the london marathon
do n t cwy podds i ll stay wiff u i ve decided to treat the whole thing as a learning experience runs will be for training purposes only therefore slow what else is new not gonna race or even try to but then again i m not competitive like that so that wo n t be hard to stick to we re gonna ave a real good time bit of a larff while we learn god i m sooooo excited must calm down must calm down must calm down etc
excellent trinity we getting ourselves put about i also looked at the dartmoor event quite fancy that now without reading all the details do you do it in pairs i usually do the lovely jog shop
here s a silly question i ve never done an ice bath how exactly do you set one up do you just throw ice cubes in a tub full of cold water and is it okay to start by just submerging your lower legs in it my injuries are usually concentrated there
on the morning of the marathon or any long run i will have a bowl of porridge with a mashed up banana and runny honey on top it s like rocket fuel and should give you a good start
jamesk it is also my first marathon but i m going to make sure i ve got lots of vaseline on those chains see you april th cheers gdave
bs i ve been in a similar situation myself when i just could n t cope with even miles week and when the long run became more than half the weeks mileage i ended up copying a guy whose weekly training pattern went race rest rest train train taper taper and race joke training perhaps but i adapted it as a salvage job for marathon training one difference was that the long run was on a saturday followed the next day by a mile bike ride ok result too too
apology accepted well enjoy and come back tomorrow morning and tell us all that you survived
dont know htp is that a garmin gps unit or something else
katypie and diana d hope your milers go well i ll be trying for tomorrow katypie you re a bit keen edinburgh s not till june
helen true aa i have considered it how long would you have to spend jogging in the pool whow long in the pool equates to what in terms of miles would appreciate some advice on aqua jogging i m seeing the osteo again to day so i will ask him about it as well i ve only had days off but i m already beginning to feel like a right lardy adn it doesnt help that people keep bringing chocolate into the office
i don t know i turn my back for minutes and all this tri stuff comes out of the woodwork again i wonder if anything can be purchased to deal with this infestation alp sounds like a good run you had hope that massage irons out those aches cc next time you are creating with the gold spray paint etc give me a shout sounds like fun you d probably end with times the mess though normski hope that treddie ache is temperorary temperorary

i think that whatever marathon you enter you have to approach it with the knowledge that every marathon is different for various reasons location size of event sponsorship etc of course the bigger the event the greater the likelyhood the crowd support will be but ofcourse the flm is a league unto it s own in regards to future training there is a wealth of information on the internet and on this rw site for marathon training depending on what time you want to achieve the easiest way to find a training schedule is to google marathon training schedules and choose one that works for you jamie the key to keeping your legs going on a bit longer is those long traning runs getting a few milers under your belt will help in addition to fine tuning your carbohydrate loading wearing a good pair of running shoes etc etc the flm is a fantastic marathon but it is n t the only one there are plenty of other great marathons out there for you to enjoy happy running

brilliant result gg many congratulations and may you be celebrating in style had a friend staying this weekend so was planning on taking the whole weekend off but did manage to fit in a quick run this morning bit of a blast with a couple of good hills and nice to get outside as so much of my running these days is just on the treadmill at lunchtime must say running outside really is far more enjoyable by far and as beders points out good long run by the way it is necessary to get used to running on hard surfaces spent the rest of the day shifting stuff to from the rubbish dump in anticipation of moving to a smaller place in london and now i ache all over so not sure what state i ll be in to do any running tomorrow bm do you recommend the total immersion book was thinking about getting it as keen to learn breast stroke and then my challenge to myself post hong kong marathon is to learn butterfly looks like a great workout hope the xc went well sarah thought of you today as it s like a mud bath down in kent at the moment and i almost got stuck on my way back when i cut through the back of the park and did the yards off road not as cold as it has been but still chilly enough that i ran in tights tops and jacket hat gloves scarf today welcome boing and david the more the merrier make sure you join in the chat and banter and let us know what you re up to and no need to lurk

hi everybody first reply so please do n t shout i have been following some of this and just to add my view i did a few mile runs to and from work about weeks before i ran the cardiff marathon last year i knocked mins off my pb now i found doing runs in a day gave me a lot of confidence i am now aiming for at flm
ever thought of joining a club will help you considerably there s bound to be someone doing flm ukathletics net cubs zone
thanks hipps cinders is a tuff ole boot so onwards and all that just played an hour on me flute and all puffed out so off to bed tomorrow is another snow filled day
thank you dd i will return the favour
diana i have a year old daughter who is single but as you know she is in australia i am not keen on asking folks for money either but its amazing how generous some folks can be once on a meal out with friends i was n t having much to drink as i was doing rfl the next day at the end of the evening i was unexpectly given as a donation for the race and i never even asked for it i have club speed session tonight and hopefully a miler at the weekend
skip you have done to much you need a break take it easy and all the hard work you have put in will pay off in the flm
karen hancock hi i think i saw you plus a couple of others running past my house canberra road this morning am looked like you were giving it some wellie made me feel a bit dispirited as i guess you were nearing the end of your long run and i was just doing my pre run stretching session with hilly and muddy miles ahead of me still i m back now and feeling quite good having done what i had planned
cheers andy i was a runner in distress
saqib good luck for the weekend i keep meaning to go onto your charity page and donate will do soon let us know how you get on we want a full run down orient good luck tonight hope you get some good news soon good news i ve lost lbs already only another to go
hi hh sdi thanks for the replys mrs j did the pengiun plan for her first lm came in at just mins after the pacer he stopped for a toilet break at miles so she did the rest on her own and never saw him overtake in the mag i received today it says they do usually m ml up to m ml in min intervals so hopefully they ll do an m ml which is what she wants it says to preregister go to this website so i ll have a look around thanks again for trying and good luck all beginning to feel a little jealous though have bigger fish this year regards jt
littlemiss well done on your first miler your next goal should be to enter a half marathon as soon as convenient if you ve done in training you re nearly there you ll be amazed how much more confident you ll be about the marathon once you ve got your first half under your belt and running in a race will give you a little idea of the atmosphere on flm day good luck
hi all i just want to wish everyone the best of luck with your training and the marathon much to my dissapointment and frustration i think i need to drop out
ttm i hope i have a similar experience as my k pb is currently over mins and i do n t plan doing one before flm but i hope expect my hm pb is actually quicker per mile than my k pb i could improve it i have found my achilles seem to suffer as my shoes wear out recommend running off road as the knackered cushioning has less detrimental effect mind you if you live in london this might not be so easy can t advice on brooks or saucony shoes tried neither
yeah just looked at results maybe i should hope for number in rd place might be more realistic took a quick look at results field was a bit slower that year so top might have been achievable not sure what the weather was like that year though
wilde rover you wont get anything until march when you get the next magazine i assume just like everyne else when i ran for a charity i got the app form and youre in magazine from them and then anything else came from flm but as i say not till sometime in march
rossendale eh know it well did the rossendale half a couple of years ago tough but excellent run started and finished at marl pit athletic track we had sun rain and hail that day

morning how are you it went really well weather was good the support from the crowd was amazing for a half marathon i ran by my watch so was quite pleased considering the fisrt miles are all up hill on the whole felt good and was glad i entered broke up the training was a nice change and with the hills you could class it as a long training run i suppose how was your weekend birthday celebrations go well training going well for both of you
bagels and more bagels
london is like no other marathon beleive me you wont need any music to keep you going
thanks mate tough night tonight i am watching a tape of carry on camping its so funny updating club records and drinking my ovaltine and catching all the running news nice session easy tommorrow i am a charlton athletic supporter and pround of it apart from the painfull end of season usual fall apart
hello guys and gals i have a straight back now but must rest for two more days as a pulled a back ligament had caused the problem in the first place light or miles saturday then easy at the stroke run on sunday i hope still days of rest might help re charge the batteries for chasing t t man at paddock wood in a weeks time thanks for the support everyone
thanks fenn decided to put something in there that was more inspiring for me i sprinted for the last yards or so on sunday in my head i had a big grin on my face but it does n t look like it from the photo my son said that if i had that much left in me by the end i should have run at a faster pace throughout the race he admitted that he might be wrong when i had stopped punching him
always aching we seem to be in the same boat i was after but also will be v happy to get and a new pb but this bl dy cold better hurry up and shift also got a new pair of shoes to wear in mizuno elixir nice great running everybody not long to go before the taper
aber that s some kind of cross training you ve got going there not sure my legs would take kindly to any high or long jumping bfb rob good luck with the long runs nice and steady does it and leave some good recovery days in the schedule afterwards sb sorry to hear you ve been ill maybe a sensible decision to lower your horizons hopefully you can enjoy the race with less pressure and still get that big new pb nl i ve been doing all my mid to long runs in some nimbus that mrs h bought me for christmas and i thought they were really heavy to start with my marathon shoes will be mizuno precisions mostly phsycological i know but they feel much faster last big speed session yesterday x m fast off secs jog recoveries averaged per rep with a couple of warm up warm down miles total just over miles last medium long midweek tonight or keep well now everyone
fabric softener i was told once to avoid using much conditioner is that the same with technical kit because it reduces the wicking effect could be wrong tho
ox excellent well done how do you know what colour start point we will be in on the rd is it to do with your expected completion time your run number or some other method

lw flm was my first marathon and i could n t believe how exhausted how felt for weeks i m gradually getting back in to my running now but if you re struggling try introducing walk breaks as this will have a mental benefit as much as anything esle if you re running for say minutes stop and walk for one minute and then do the same again all the way to the end of your run you can eliminate the walk breaks once you ve fully recovered or take less of them if you ve got used to the strategy and its advantages at flm i walked for minute at the end of each mile up to so even towards the end i could still keep going by saying only ish more minutes until my next break i ran without breaks after mile i recovered much quicker because of this strategy and i m still using it now i ran miles days after flm with walk breaks of course give it a try and see if it helps best of luck
pinks speed sessions are usually pretty much flat out bursts of up to mile hr a tempo session is a more sustained speed session up to hrs these are done at about of maximum hr hr
jej pbs by the dozen was the another slow run race dana ah the kebab shops of nottingham i used to be an expert in em back in my student days but yeah i know what you mean i think i ve been cranking it up a bit now that the clothes have come off where s your money for the cricket dan good morning session for england is it the first yately this wednesday
gd just doing m in this heat is an achievement i got up really early to run my m started really slow as legs felt a little heavy after yesterdays hill session then picked up the pace a little felt nice and easy came home in av started cool ended very hot took on almost litres and have been drinking ever since
pugs if your was a pb then i would n t worry you re still getting faster and you re not injured
tmr i agree with the not blasting off statement you made regarding xc races in the local sunday league races last season i blasted off with the leaders and by the end of the race was holding on i then ran the bigger xc races such as the southerns mike gratton will remember that one and the nationals at parly hill i started off very steady in these races let my eager team mates shoot off in front then spent the whole race slowely picking off runners in fact i overtook all my team mates and made up around odd places and finished feeling pretty strong as well
just phoned to find out when my form would be posted out only to be told they had n t received my letter requesting one same goes for the oh s letter too will get another letter off in the post tomorrow just as well i checked though
sorry to read of so many with injuries hope you re able to get back to running soon daisy d if you have a question for mike g then yes post it on here and i m sure he ll answer it mike out of interest are your schedules suitable for all levels of runner or do you need to have a background of a few years running at a reasonable mileage first i m planning to start your marathon schedule at the beginning of dec after a goal k race would i be following exactly the same plan as last year and also should i expect to be starting from a slightly higher level and be seeing slightly faster paces on my steady and lt runs at present i m running steady paced runs at around pace on a mildly undulating course
nothing gone from my account either although a cheque for which was highlighted yesterday is now not highlighted i take it any transactions that should go out today would be highlighted now and there arnt any so that means nothing going out of my account today me thinks why are my posts so complicated wonder if the flm organisors are sat in their offices reading this and laffin at us cos todays not the day anyway
katepie well done done

hi mn o welcome stick around and see what you think when the thread started not all that long ago i d never done a sub hr half marathon hrr i must confess that i m not drinking any more than usual not because i m genetically half cactus like the person who wrote the rambling letter to that effect in the current rw but because my fluid intake is quite generous anyway and because i do n t sweat enormously and before a long run i carbo load so well that there s probably enough water bound up with the glycogen in my legs to keep me going at this time of year i only take drinks on runs lasting over two and a half hours obviously it s different in summer
hi dm all you are spot on about the club situ i was with a club now moved up to the hills and became slower now that l run by myself can l ask those people that are following a schedule how comes they are doing so much milage above the weeks sessions do they benifit from the extra milage what sessions do they add it too and finally have they put in their schedules befor and benefited from it all
thanks bowi how do i know if i have the seat at the right height when my leg is in the most extended position should it be completely straight or slightly bent also if i am doing it for cross training do i have low resistance and go faster or is it better to have higher resistance or is it just about doing a certain distance in a certain time i did miles in minutes
a from e wonderful best nights sleep ever counting sheep my uncle farmed sheep in the bowland area i recall him counting in this way lsr miles then mile race next week gc dont worry about switching as long as you get your lsr s in during the training period and do not overdo weekly milage
alroight bab i m a brummie who didnt get in flm but have everything crossed for grn praps flm so if ya dont moind oi ll pop in from toime to toime to pick up some hints n tips tips
evening all very impressed by everyones s efforts i did mile lsr on sunday in just under mm s and felt very comfortable which is a good sign never run that far before so pretty happy with the progress cant wait for the brighton hm in weeks time anyone else doing this bit sore after squash tonight dont think i stretched enough being a physio i should know better looking forward to the fun of the hills tommorow night cheers jules

good luck with all of the lsrs this weekend guys as predicted i have done nothing this week but had a great conference got some excellent results and had some real fun but workload late nights and booze have not helped to get me motivated to run rugby at the weekend together with long drives down through west wales and then cardiff will mean no running till monday and then it gets cold but it will have to kick off whatever the weather have a good time all all
anyone doing cranleigh or worthing
here s a bizarre thought my mother just sent me a text to say that my symptoms sound just like when my skinny and weak younger sister had anaemia i ve tried nigh on everything else look like a few irons pills and some guiness then ws all the best i m most impressed with your return to top form eb ive been advised that the best splits for mortals are and so h m ish for me
cinders sorry i meant thanet just got a text from hippo she is coming up to miles

ta i hate to admit it but i am too
susan i estimated hours in my original application and i m in pen so i guess that is where to go for i think pen might be the keen types that we are not worthy of being associated with starting to get close nervous and excited its shimmering heat on the course today my office is just past the mile mark mark
learning how to do the samba lol night night xx
dread to think what you might have found in your dish after pm
put your stats up anna
i reckon it should say we should aim to run slower me being a bit dense i never adjust my plans run at my normal pace blow up at miles end up walking lose half hour
i ran for jdrf which funds research into cures and causes of type diabetes a friend just popped in with some sponsorship money she s got two diabetic sons and is besides herself with gratitude for my efforts she said if there was ever a cure they d sell the house and live in a caravan if it meant they could pay for treatment to cure their boys feel quite emotional about it
i had to raise for breakthrough breast cancer but i was talking to someone during the race who only had to raise i forget which charity it was though dark blue vest but not anthony nolan
how do you think you d do if you ran it kp can you see how you feel later in the week choc muffins sound yum
time for a quick totp before i head to the gym
s c again i will be following your training with progress as i am launching another attack on sub myself a few weeks prior to your marathon the mhr test was self tested doing the session you suggest the problem being that i find it hard to push myself hard enough running on a treadmill even with my friend standing next to me shouting encouragement what are your hill sessions
bowi i am with you about oldies trying to tell you waht they used to do i qualified for a swimming teacher back in and a karate shotokn instructer in and a gym instructor in but would not even think of telling people what to do as things have changes so much each year how long ago was it that runners had never heard of gels etc
just been checking out the two oceans website miles one day the same little voice that sat on my shoulder this time last year and whispered sub marathon is beginning to mutter at me two oceans marathon most of the route s wonderful we ve spent two chunks of time in cape town and it s beautiful round there def some big lumps of rock around though think table mountain etc
sc i am sure you can calm this down again with a little common sense little race news from me for miles today i was a little flat today but this is still my first official time under mins some way behind my km split at woodley but then i have been a little busy plodding and resting lately have a nice day
dot i think it s the same but i do n t look back in races so have never seen his face he generally beats ronnie o sullivan his local celeb rival in the essex scene the results are up already it seems that most people are seconds down on last year two members of coronium s club who went sub last year were about a minute up this time the winner seemed to have a very good race for the guy closest to me who beat me by seconds has bagged a couple of decent hms this year nm it s a great site set up by a club mate hence the inclusion of my times from the days when was more like my m time it gives a whole new angle of post race analysis especially in xc where i can see how those around me compare on the roads
hi nicky good to hear from you hope you get better soon and rio hope the foot is improving after ice and rest what bad timing debs do you get rw mag if yes there was a separate flyer in it about a k in sept in epping forest which looks good have you ever run there i never have as i would n t like to go there on my own and i guess i do n t like mud very much either but i m v tempted if you do n t get it go to www trailplus com and click on puma urban escape
although vb i think bucks oxon tends to be a bit more affluent that delightful romford so you may find we re a bit cheaper than in your neck of the woods
ah now i wear shorty shock absorber shorts for massage therapy what did physio say ts
sorry guys gagging to tell you but want to leave it to nearer the date for reasons that will become apparent when i spill the beans i fly out a couple of days before the race so i ll certainly let you know before i take off jej i think i ve got a good chance if there is n t too much wind and the course is n t too hilly i expecct to hit the start line a couple of pounds heavier than for flm but should be about the same weight as when i ran abingdon last year my main worry is cramp but i have a cunning plan in place to avoid that courtesy of my triple iron man clubmate he acted as a pacemaker at abingdon and watched me suffer on the way round i ll be taking what he takes to stop it hopefully it should work pm not confirming anything anything
jej i l go tipptop b i m racing the burtonwood miler tomorrow just a steady m m i reckon will do me lovely weather out there for a miler pug pug
omg a girl pops out for a little retail therapy and you guys gossip like crazy sorry rio if i ve missed you but good luck for the weekend will keep checking tv listings gatton i ve already wished you well for your physio appointment i m in for the half but am confused whether it s mk or brighton sm where s your picture daz are you practising being bashful by removing yours what s going on vb you have to ditch the cow print knickers pleaze
rio congratulations again you truly are amazing can t believe that you re even contemplating going out tonight gatton take it easy on wednesday

lf congrats on your new job once you ve been sat at a desk for a few hours you ll be bursting with energy and itching to get your trainers back on great run at a cracking pace the previous run was obviously your body having an easy day but i often feel like that euph yes looking forward to selby hm but have another long run around miles to get in on friday then i ll start looking towards the taper next week with some strides and shorter sessions i m hoping it wo n t be too windy unlike today when i ve almost been blown off my feet where is haltemprice btw was looking at your list of k races as trying to find a good k course ceal thanks for your comments now that it s getting towards the xc season i m having to look a bit harder for k on the road with a good course hopefully i ll find one soon as do n t have one planned at the moment dfd the mental images which your post conjured up were just mad you take it easy on those step ladders and running to school do n t want any non running induced injuries on the thread could you please impart some of your mental pre race strategies as i m really interested eddie welcome back you ve been very quiet over the summer and will no probably steam in with a marathon pb at leicester ozy great run last night and it s even better when you ve run that far you feel justified in eating as much food as you like well done clairster that sounds like an excellent session which turns out to be even better when you ve run at a pace like that and did n t even realise it ls now you know you can achieve anything no barriers no mental obstacles sub awaits in your next hm have you got a garmin stick to the pace like glue if you have did a pretty hard session on the track last night with the club which was x min efforts with a decreasing recovery so first rest period was seconds then then then min repeated times just when we thought we d finished we had m jog recovery then ran m which i did n t do at full pelt as would probably have crocked myself but still managed which was n t too bad at the end of a work out today is windy as hell here the trees are bending in half i think wind is one thing i hate the most as a runner rain snow sun etc i can cope with but wind is very energy sapping the only thing worse is when it s combined with rain or snow miles at lunchtime at a fairly steady pace plenty of races at the weekend with the biggies including gnr berlin marathon
tt la rochelle is indeed allegedly a flat course its a lapper which i know not everyone likes but i m happy to give it a go looks a bit fiddly at times round the old port though its been won in a men and women in recent years be a nice weekend away if nothing else

wahey bowi
how proud am
evening all nowt to report just popping in to say hello did a really good weights session a the gym today but i m shattered from it now ts glad to hear he got the right verdict just sorry you had to deal with it all all
i do like a good debate and it looks like i ve missed a few good ones on here today i ve got a new run plan i m moving into moving things on from to runs per week in the next month most of my mileage on weeknights is with club due to increased work hours so i m going to take advantage this winter by doing as many miles at the weekend as i can tuesday ndash club night ndash as with ppb s varies but with slower talking pace at the start culminating in hard surges at the end a few regroup stops so i consider this an easy session wednesday short easy the run i m most likely to dump thursday ndash club speedwork tempo run or fartlek with the fast group if not the club then i ll do tempo or intervals saturday ndash at this time of year this is my have some fun run one of only two weekly opporutunities to run in the light trail hills maybe both but not too hard sunday ndash when i m not racing this is lsr day in marathon training last time i was anywhere between miles early on to later in my plan tended to bounce between as would only do a m lsr once every two weeks my average for the last two complete months before marathon month was so roughly averaging mpw i ve never run monthly mileage that high before or since i think i needed to run m in a run and then get another in through marathon paced or other sessions each week its what i needed to run a good marathon at windermere i also went out my way to run hilly routes which built my confidence for tackling an undulating hilly marathon do the same for flm and you ll be quids in as you ll have energy to burn on the long flats of the flm this time i want to do more i ve planning to hit average mpw by december and by mid january my plans involve over marathon length races so i may try and push on beyond mpw on occasions like nick i ll ramp down a week occasionally nick glad you enjoyed endured bishop wilton if anybody ever tells you east yorks is flat you can now force feed them their empty words that hill to the east of bishop wilton is mean as mean as the one at gf but without paving to get grip from that was the significant hill at our xc there i also found a few boggy bits oddly the rest of the course was easier than this weeks at drewton woods nearer hull but that one hill took enough out of everyone to make the rest of the course a painful affair bounding back down it at the end was n t fun either the sort of steep bumpy uneven descent only beders could enjoy
ah great news re paris just need to get your hip sorted out now at present i plan to do all marathons i have done in a month before and felt ok friend did london and stratford last year and he is in his s and he managed and he ran london with his son and because it was a training run and no pressure he really enjoyed it my plan is to treat two of them as training runs and one as a serious pb attempt on the basis i am not a paula and doubt that i will be digging deep into my last reserves in any of the runs i should be able to recover easily enough who am i kidding plodding hippo does them all the time so why not aim is to get up to and then retire didds sorry to hear about your ankle
jc if you have members you should be getting two club places up to is place then a place for every thereafter ie places places places
i d like to vote for mouse as i know she is a determined creature and she would love to go sub hours i feel certain she would value the training and it would inspire her to beat her mara pb pb
how about the andrex toilet roll london marathon or would that make me seem like a low bum
lol not a dirty word here today mr c is currently doing some hoovering i m half waving a duster around
i have a glass of red in my hand but only because we have a bottle thats been open a bit too long for cooking the majority of the time i ll drink nothing at all this must be my first drink since new year and even then i only had one glass of champers and one bottle of beer also welcome silver fox wish i could do miles at minute mile
the short sighted desperate ones that live round my way once it gets warm and the training layers come off i get mobbed by em i bet they re already looking forward to spring time
i would n t be so presumptious gatton
week seven day three wednesday my schedule says m approx mins steady my timex says m in it did n t feel steady on the tready as i said earlier i tried to focus on running tall and keeping my trunk stretched the pain in my butt ock diminished quickly and i tried to stare at one particular point on the wall in front of me and ran towards it i kept my form for about m but the last mile was a real struggle and i could n t keep the right body shape but i got there splits all around the m mark apart from the first and last i can feel the pain in my butt ock again now and i know that no matter how i sit it s going to hurt to stand up but once i m in motion again it gets better in the morning i m going to play around with the seat in my car because i suspect the settings have been changed whilst it s been repaired and then serviced during the past fortnight i ve never understood why people who work on cars never ever return the seat to the position they found it in when they got in it s one of my soapbox topics grrrrr i have a new problem on monday night during the hills i clipped a kerb with my right foot and almost fell over i think i must have jarred my big toe because i woke up last night and it was throbb ing and it s doing it again now it s a funny colour too after the miami marathon which trin and i did last january this particular big toe went a funny colour and the nail died and in fact it took about weeks to fully grow back again the last time that happened to me was after i broke a big toe but i do n t think i did that in miami but it s not happy at all at the moment i had planned to run m tomorrow this being the run i did n t do last saturday when i brought this week s runs forward by hrs however in the light of my currrent aches and pains and because i have no idea when i m going to get home tomorrow evening i m going to take tomorrow as a rest day and have days off in a row steve mc i hope this is ok
oh to get back to doing miles
gatton we will have bags of confidence after oakley thinking we might need some sustinence along the way is it peanut butter sanis you like can arrange for something at mile or thereabouts and then the same spot on the second smaller loop
i dont feel much quicker when i run without the weight at the moment pq though maybe my tri training and some concentrated speedwork will help would like to go sub for that one
well well well been affy busy at work but sneaking a peak at evryone s exploits over the weekend it looks like the thread is really rocking big welcome to the new folks as the saying goes you do n t have to be mad to post on here but it helps beders that sounded like a really tough run on saturday no wonder your legs were knackered afterwards a few days in the sun will help no doubt well done on getting the miler nailed crazy lady the wind is a toughener is n t it not to mention a pain in the arse wow little stoker on your feet brilliant stuff and quite rightly a massive confidence booster i absolutely loved your reports of the trollers race clairster euph it brings back thoughts of the osmotherley phoenix which was such a blast last year brilliant running by both of yu too so glad you had a great run clairster you deserve that after by your standards a bit of an indifferent start to the year onwards and upwards congrats to the chelsea plodder family for a very productive outing on sunday moggie wey hey absolutely stonking performance did you win a prize with that time i think we all probably understand about running the race in your mind definitely more than half the battle imho a great great run and probably a thread record too good to hear from you left foot and sounds like there is more in the tank despite running a fast half bodes well for your luxembourg marathon night nurse fanfare of trumpets
jd rfj good luck for east hull tomorrow drk happy birthday retirement that sounds good am heading for a career break myself hoping to take a year to months off to spend loads of time with family been working away for years and put fulfill a few ambitions i finish mid may and ca n t wait thinking of triathlon for next challenge as will have the time for more training lorenzo sounds like a good race bet you feelt great passing others in second half must learn how to do that in the last miles of a marathon any tips miles for me this morning with a few sprints mixed in ready for a long one in the morning morning
well done everyone on their long runs great to hear they are going well i did mine yesterday miles in hrs so pleased with that and also the longest ever run before but knee is aching a bit so i need to take it easy again this week wondering if i could have a bit of advice from steve if possible i m due to do the bath half at the weekend though the schedule says m should i go for a few miles before after and do it at slow pace marathon pace depending on how i m feeling or should i be happy just doing the i m not going to go all out again as doing that in the berkhamsted meant i had trouble running properly all week with very heavy legs thanks very much
bootsie have a nice weekend ts hope you get your leg sorted i am hoping to see you at beachy head this year year
aah that looks more like it wind and rain time for my run
bootsie do n t worry about missing training this late on unless it is because of a medical problem sorry ankles will clear up and most training now is topping off and contributes to only a small of your fitness compared to what you have accumulated so far in the bulk of your work work
tl any more details on skye half when in june mrs puffy would love it but i have a colleague who is going on holiday in june and may not be able to get time off she is a mcrae but born in hythe near where shimmy lives i think think
dot good summary good to see everyone getting excited nervous about the approaching big day hellip its what all the early mornings running in sleet etc hellip is about ndash and hopefully it will worthwhile for everyone i am trying a different approach to tapering this year basically less of it last miler tomorrow to make up miles for the week i intend to do around miles next week with all out k on the saturday a very slow miler on the sunday then drop to miles for the following week including rest days and a x blast on the tuesday this is a result of finding the running a lot easier this year hellip probably because i have run and got used to putting in a lot more slower miles i e mm it might be wrong but will see how it goes on the
good lord how on earth did people ever manage before gps was invented you use the mile markers and a wristwatch
metcheck has changed already no rain and temp feel like to winds of mph

rob on another site someone asked who the nutter from blackheath who led the race was seeing the state jamie was in when i passed him at about miles i assumed it was him
people who have multiple partial entries i would n t worry too much if you read the pages you would have seen that multiple entries will make all void unless due to technical problems if you ve got two entries where you ve filled in all details including payments and got confirmations for both then worry if you ve only gone part way through before it crashed then i should think you ll get sorted in the end even if it s a pain i guess in such cases they ll automatically delete entries with only partial information they are not going to count an entry without payment details are they someone asked if they were registered if they were getting a message that their email had been used for a registration my guess is if you did n t get past that page probably not or at least only a partial see above it s possible they are using cookies little files that say you ve visited a page that are stored on your computer if so in some cases people could be getting this message but flm has no record on their system of your visit it s all on yours personally as i ve got a confirmation from worldpay i reckon i ve got some proof and i m letting things die down a bit before i get onto them i think if i had not got either email and i had n t got to the payment stage then i d probably try again and sort out multiples later if it came to that but without definitive advice from flm i guess everyone needs to make their own mind up what s best to do for them
i did n t have my name on my shirt a pity now as i did n t realise how much shouting there would be the mp players one is a difficult one i can understand people wearing them some people may have the music they need to get them through a hard session i suppose its habits and whatever makes you feel comfortable there are quite a few marathons in america where they are banned though interesing topic of discussion discussion
clairster goes pretty high eh
ah back in the day i was one of the strange people in camden with my bright red extensions and many rings in my ears lip nose i can imagine the frubes there running around asking lots of embarassing questions questions
jools ok you re the boss i ll be quiet i just wonder about ks and intervals when you re rehabbing just been for a hammer on thr bike round some lanes it s a fair effort to average mph esp with that long cllmb out of portsmouth
sue i was going to pop it round sorry to leave you to last anyone else who is not on the list if you mail me or have mailed me i will double check and confirm with you whether it has been sent or whether i have still got you to do
evening all fantastic run for me tonight with the club mostly off road with a few tough hills but managed miles at pace so really pleased especially as legs still feel quite tired from the weekend at least people commented on the speed i ran someone had their weetabix this morning etc hrr before paris i had plans a the very unrealistic by that stage sub b sub also unrealistic c sub d a pb and u e u sub so i completely understand i was telling a guy from the paris forum about how many fallback plans i had the day before and he thought i was ridiculous said what s the different between and etc but i know there s a huge difference in my crazed mind anyway even though sub does n t mean anything i would have liked to have got closer to than i knew it was silly it was strange i simply could n t keep up pace at paris and yet at london i m pretty sure i ran pace until well after miles sorry to start babble about myself strange how thinking about edinburgh has been making me reflect about paris london so much have come to lots of conclusions about both but wo n t bore you with them will absolutely totally be rooting for you all on sunday remember all your best mantras and mental tricks everyone and run like the wind with the wind ah i do n t remember the wind bothering me that much last year i was just too busy being grateful that it was n t hot like london do remember a small stretch along the coast when it was worse than other times but nothing too bad really by the way i know i mentioned i had been perusing the abingdon website recently but i just realised i am doing cardiff half that day so no worries about getting tempted now phew
thanks tu tu fantastic running from all cant wait for the stories awful weather here hope they had it a bit better

brief running history started years ago when i became a london cabbie just for a bit of exercise entered my first race mnths ago and have been steadily improving with each race am nearly and have just clocked for a k on a rain soaked muddy surface so there is definately more to come my best half marathon is that was in march but i should be a lot fitter now i train days a week about miles and have always used runners world schedules and pace calculators which have been spot on so far my predicted marathon time is which is probably quicker than my cab i currently weigh about st lb so im looking more like a kenyan by the day it would be great to run london i ve heard so much about it from other runners so good luck to everyone who enters this competition competition
ah tarkers i fear you are exhibiting a lack of charity and tolerance there try running past a football stadium on match day and you will be dodging past fat pie eating groups of lads but you ca n t complain it means all the bigotted over aggressive oiks in one place letting off steam on each other rather than their families and other innocents or am sunday morning past your local church is going to be frustrated by tottering old biddies trying to get into the lord s good books before it s too late again can you really begrudge this last desperate act they ve paid their taxes and fought wars for us and now in credit crunch uk the last thing we want is that those with the good fortune to have the means at their disposal to stop spending yes quentin s new iphone undeserving little brat though he may be means a shop assistant keeping his job means the sandwich shop he buys his butty from stays open means the shopkeeper can afford to buy a new house means that you do n t fall further into negative equity yes tarkers those people you curse are saving you the worry and stress that could send you to an early grave please be a little more thankful in future
no snow here in wet hampshire a rare treat at club tonight i got there and it was a track session another rarity for me so m in total with x m very pleased with that set as first time ever of getting a set under mins busy weekend with races hants xc k on sat and victory m on sun take care all and keep up the good trg

ive alway use to be a whipper snapper at the short stuff in the day i was capable of a sub min mile oh how i wish i didnt give up for a few years
oops typo meant and or was it maybe i did run it twice a guy did so at hastings mara in december
dad of two wrote hmmm so the height weight thing is still going eh well i m and currently st lb racing weight last couple of years has been around the st mark give or take a lb i m happy with that and feel a lot stronger and healthier than i did yrs ago when i had a cycle racing weight of about st lb and i have n t got any taller in the meantime i pretty much eat what i want to and the same with drinking i like a snifter now and then but i m not what some would call a big drinker point is for me that i run to feel good generally speaking if i run faster i feel better but if i start to feel that i m losing all round strength or that the end feeling good is being overtaken by the means running faster or losing weight then alarm bells start ringing in my head well we all know my opinion on weight so i m not going to dig that lot up again all i know is i ll be running so much quicker it s untrue when this weight is off my lungs and legs do n t actually feel too bad considering the lack of training but when you ve got lbs of flab to lose that s alot of minutes for free doing weight sessions per week nothing to build any muscle this time around just for strength and definition as the weight piles off actually tonight is shoulders arms followed by an miler down the club now where s my lettice leaf cheers pug
lol dot dids oh well at least we can get use to a marathon season of you predicting world records or injuries to everyone nothing like keeping it positive run well dan
hi pauline can you help i m currently doing my long runs at pace and have built up to miles i m a marathon first timer and hope to get as close to as i possibly can but i m worried that to get even close to i will need to run faster and for longer than any of my training runs which i ca n t get my head around should i be doing some of my long runs faster hope you can reply many thanks ci
well done pavey and sarah brilliant running you guys are great total respect rest up for a few days you deserve it big time legends
wonder how they are doing or have done
hi steve my trainers have done hundred miles will it be ok to wear new ones and do you think this might eliminate some of the problems fl i m not sure what this problem is it s hard to say but i ll be trying my best to get over it not sure about running times whilst injured although i ve had similar type of problem after some marathons in the past but i ve always put that down to giving my all during the run i was n t right for new york and should in hindsight have pulled out but if you go all that way then you got to run
barley please do n t assign me to a particular group as i wo n t be at mudchute the whole time and will be a roving ff supporter thanks

hi all officially tapering now did my miles today and feeling very confident and happy been injured for last weeks and managed to complete it with no niggles anyone fancy opening a couple of bottles of fizz now cheers
i m a bit worried about you lot you re discussing running and the acshual race group have moved on from yesterdays discussion on marmite and why the b pings off my laptop to who needs a good spanking with my hairbursh and podds greyhound not spanked with the greyhound have we got the wrong idea
p s and yeah if a man who has only recently re learned to walk can complete the marathon i ve really got nothing to complain about
hope you have a lovely easter too mrs s have a good break from work morning es hope you re all well well
well done marmite what kind of structure have you got to your training at the moment well raced br and hilly hh good decision to call it if you were struggling but i m a bit confused you say you want to do in a few weeks time so as i can see it your rep paces were pretty much spot on your rep times to race pace work out as m k m k m k m m that to me looks about what you should be doing rather than too fast or have i missed something do n t forget it was quite warm y day as well so that would have contributed to this feeling harder on top of the track session the day before tr hope the run went well chin up there s still another days have you gotten it checked out try taking some calcium and magnesium supplements they may help with the spasming seriously wtgy well done on rd lol was trying to remember what proper runners do to drop people and what are you then if not a proper runner coro i wore the adizero s for the tt again yesterday i think they are now my new favourite shoe they just seem more conducive to faster running they re a little harder than the streaks but that seems to suit me a bit better for faster stuff legs were a little heavy this morning unsurprising after fartlek on tuesday and a tt yesterday so with a hour run coming up this pm i kept my recovery even more gentle than usual as rb is not around to do his pace police bit m m m i think that is the slowest i ve run outside of a cool down all year i m starting to enjoy my little jogs as my second runs though
are you resting claire claire
text run to i think you get a return text with a link to a website where you put in the race number
rat do n t worry everybody s the same this week i ve been having niggly niggles in just about every part of my body and only today did i walk out of the house and feel that yes maybe my legs were in fact getting the benefits of the taper and starting to feel good and strong by friday you ll be bursting with energy and feeling fit go for the massage by all means but tell them it s with the flm in mind mind
great pics to nam been thinking about tri for a while now but just cant get on with the swin front crawl last a couple of lenghts m pool and breaststroke takes about a hour for a mile dread to think about open water water
engrose not sure you should follow the menu too closely i m not sure that i ll be eating a dry baked potato or a tin of fruit right up for the ice cream though it said scoops of ben jerry s yes wotsit i think i have been looking at a different menu no surprise there though is anyone else really hungry all the time since tapering off no ones food is safe in my office god forbid if they take a pause while eating i look hopefully in their direction in case there is any food going
i feel your pain livvy
hurrah i ve entered oh damn sorry i meant that a friend of mine has entered that s what i meant coz i m never doing a marathon again ever you have n t seen me here right

need some help and advice please have developed a pressure sore on my heel at the top of the back of my shoe what s the best or quickest way to heal this i ve been running in these shoes for about two weeks and they seem fine had n t given any sign of rubbing or problems it was when i walked miles in them that the agravation occurred it was meant to be a sneaky way of getting the kids some exercise by walking them to their grandparents before running back for the car i seem to have developed a habit for picking up injuries from non running activities any suggestions for a quick cure thanks thanks
my oh has got in four entries in a row although there were gaps between entries
jools taper for edinburgh starts tomorrow so easy ish days now unless i get carried away at wokingham next sun mtr good work on the particularly if it was in the rain i just about managed to avoid that did not look much fun br hilly now that sounds like a lovely run this morning all the best for weds br looking forward to hilly s m race report bang and there was the line should cover it it
my god the telly this evening must have been even more dull than usual matt fwiw i ran a minute positive split so perhaps or thereabouts on a warm day is on the money who knows anyhow in an effort to add a little more life and excitement into the thread i present my hogweed trot race report target was was the score on the doors and either my pacing was abysmal their mile markers were out or the wind and from about mile onwards heavy rain had more of an effect than i realised or two or more all of the above anyway fwiw splits were rd lady and a mug to match last year s plate also rd lady in
i m doing the north downs k with mr shimms on sunday omahd should be a nice one
as a dyslexia therapist i m not so hung up on spelling errors running has felt quite tough this week had to abort speed sessions that makes me realise i ca n t do speedwork the week following a half marathon i m just not recovering like i used to sadly and as much as i do n t like to admit it it must be to do with age
i used to have to leave at least a couple of hours otherwise i got stitch for several of my lsrs over the winter i had nothing before going out other than liquids sports drinks i m trying to get used to haveing at least a light brekkie before i go just means getting up even earlier for daytime sessions i still leave hours if i can prefer to feel empty when i run wel just away then
burn those schedules and run free hopefully it ll be nice and warm here early in the morning too i like training when its stinking hot but i need to be all done by and i doubt it ll be that warm by then
i d just be interested to know
had n t really thought about this yet i ve done milers for the last sundays so i feel ok at the moment
thanks mecca much appreciated its the only thing that keeps me going on those old wintery runs knowing that i have to do it
personally do n t think that going up to marathon training would be beyond you i d take it if i were you
and as a previous applicant they should send you one automatically
i ca n t seem to stop eating whenever i can stay awake long enough have n t seemed to gain any weight but then not lost any trouble i had last year was that after themarathon training deminished and weight started to gain only answer start training for this year year
that sounds good ht maybe i should offer him a suck on my energy juice
can u make it about only these guys start at sharp and do n t hang around for anyone if you plan to get changed you might want to make it about as there are changing facilities there i ll be changed already i prefer to get home and showered there is a courtesy charge of p per run i ll chip in for both of us think i can afford it
yes forget about carrying anything listen to the crowd last year i knew that khalid kannouchi and paula had won and that kk not me i m kk had set a world record by actually talking to the crowd plus talk to others round you and say thank you to the waterstop people and the kids offering sweets and banana and it s great rythym you ll be fine
i know just what you mean tibby i m following the runners world schedule to the letter t and its killing me watching my running pals including my husband doing longer and faster runs than me but the tapering is recommended by experts with years of experience so who are we to argue last year after a weeks holiday and no running i ran the fastest k of my life so there s something to be said for rested muscles good luck
well not after you ve just peeled it off your sweaty foot anyway
hi guys it was good to meet up before the start i thought it was an excellent day having my name on the shirt seemed a bit tacky at the start but when my knee packed up at miles it really helped everyone calling my name i thought the last seven miles was going to be a long walk to the finish but i managed to slow jog and walk most of it so i guess i should not be too disappointed with the time considering even though i do feel a bit gutted next year year
my sister did it last year and she is a huge stone munter exagerating maybe just a bit it took her hours but she did it it is a matter of the mind
help me i ve never done it before i m worried that i m not doing enough yet to get me thu it and i gotta get thru this
blister you have a great memory you are spot on with my time for cardiff do n t be frightened i do not have natural talent and no way could i compete with your times but you are right on lol all down to hard work i feel deeply honoured that i inspire you but i am just keen to do as well as i am able to do thats all you fast guys inspire me to work even harder and i ca n t wait to beat my bullying training partner only minutes faster than me i will get him
what was the bad one dips rain rain and more rain
blue start minutes cowhill plodder lll man in black plodding p susiebee xfr bear others green start always aching lizzyb minni spans others red start blisters calf others
my first too and i ca n t believe how fresh i felt did n t have a dip and felt great all the way round i actually went off a bit too slowly and so had tons of energy left for the last miles ended up running like the clappers to get under hours sorry if you were one of the people i barged out of the way the congestion was a little frustrating to say the least and i think if i do another marathon it will be a quieter one where i ll see if i can improve on my time missed the forumites at mile but the rest of the crowds were great not sure i d have been happy to stand in that weather for hours text messages a bit disappointing too
ahhh thinking back i do n t think i did did i it was definately not in my bag anyway what would it have been doing on my shoulder
hi all can i play too i m looking at a nice long slow marathon some time next year missed out on the long run this weekend as had a rather parenty weekend both sets but off to the gym tonight for the first time in over a month got to get back into it
you are so cruel cougie
cc normski hope you guys had a good run this morning would have loved to join you but stuck at work boring cc are you still planning on doing the race on sunday did a really good session last night at arena minutes running fast as poss then minute stop and rest then three minutes back to where we started did reps absolute killer think i m comming down with a chest cold noooooooo apparently some peeps are starting to get responses from flm ca n t breath so excited have asked my other half to let me know if there is any post for me acn t wait until i get home emma have you had any news yet
hi nemo hi all nemo you re doing well apart from a long run at weekends i m only managing one other in midweek but at least i m doing a long one i m in the nikelondon race on sunday night wave look out for me i ll be in a bright yellow long sleeve t shirt
did n t do my race today it was cancelled because of the ice i got mr debbo to let me out of the car on the way to his mum s and i did miles along back roads in fife instead i think it s time to relax and read some of my christmas books now
thanks for that i will probably still arrive too early i am one those people who get hung up on time i hate being late for anything so i usually end up being far too early
it s also possible that you are more tired mid week due to work etc whereas you are more rested by a sunday morning although you had a tough nd long run you will probably gain from it as you ran when you felt tired quite a valuable exercise for marathon training
hippo you really didnt taste the sprouts at all it was really nice i have a smoothie maker but i dont know if it would cope with the veggies
do n t know what you re fretting about greg you ran a half marathon at per mile well i m years younger than you have been running three years and would kill to be able to do that pace for miles believe me a bit of anxiety is not just understandable it s actually pretty healthy if you were n t having any doubts you d be unique what you do n t yet understand is that the day itself the occasion and the crowds will make your heart twice as big as it feels now just you wait and see honest greg you re doing just fine best of luck andy
janee well done very good time reading sounds as though it was a busy half so loads of folks to run alongside good experience for london
not been yet hs hope to go out about pm alp sorry you ca n t make it on friday like you say next time hs are you coming on friday then
blisters the quacks have said exactly that and reassured me that he s not dehydrated yet he seems to be getting worse actually kissing him on the lips is the least of my worries he s not yet big enough to aim for the bucket and i seem to cop the lot every time aa i like your top tips re children and avoiding the lurgy i think i ll send my hubby and z away for the first weeks in april swayer hope that hip gets better soon an easy recovery run for me last night and another planned for today tomorrow i will rest prior to hastings on sunday sunday
no help to you now but next year apply for the gold bond even before the ballot then ifyou get a ballot place you just let the charity have the gold bomnd back i thought the alzheimers peeps had some left
i ve taken a few days off from training i feel as guilty as hell for missing my long run but i m sure i ll feel worse if i ca n t run on the big day
fifidella like you say not a great course but it gives you an idea of what it s like to run with a lot of other people great time by the way anything about for the half calculates to for the marathon but you can never tell until the day i did last year in the same race and ended up finishing london in due to a calf strain at miles hoping to improve on that this year though
hi thanks to all who responded to my comments placed last week i receive notifications but somehow i cannot read your responses shame as some of the help and advise that i have read sounds to be good finished silverstone in hrs mins improvement of mins on last year on target at miles and even ran with the min mile pacer but from miles seemed to be treading water missed a number of mile markers so really please when i saw the mile marker and managed sprint to line miles in morecambe next week trimpell so hoping for a hr min target will try the flapjack refueling instead of lucazade to see if that aids well done everyone keep going not long to go now and again apologies for not being able to read your responses will keep reading the posted comments for ideas and help take care
i have not trained last week missed hours of midweek training runs missed what would have been my nd marathon distance this last sunday as yet i still not been able to train this week because of a pulled thigh muscle this sunday should be a what do i do as my training prog stipulates that after this weekend i should start tapering off at present it s not looking good for this weekend let alone light training runs this week
panties kids were in the bar post flm they were indeed angelic i will be there might not make sense tho might be nissed
hallo all the pringles thing was just what you could eat instead for same calories men s health is great straight talking i love going to the hairdresser to read it how strange am i they had lots of stuff from rw in it too everyone is doing really well and i am really pleased that you have all come into my life in this strange but wonderful way we ve been thru all the ups and downs and i ve been motivated and inspired by you all i went out in the pouring bl dy rain for m hours tonight the water of leith had burst its banks at several points and my new trainers are wrecked ha ha i could have swam in the canal and been drier was good tho and i feel i must be quite strong now mentally and physically so a good way to enter the taper tavern
i m dreading that idiot on the train sneezing over me and giving me his germs yuck
tallguy do n t beat yourself up about it competing while under the weather is always difficult so sub hours with a bug is not bad at all welcome back sweep it s a shame about your injury a while back but atleast you ve been sensible and have set a lower target that should be more achievable there s so many of us with knee injuries on here prohibition e is tonight the night when you re allowing yourself a drink open water swimming is n t that scary as long as you re really slow like me in last years firth of forth race i had a canoe next to me from about m into the race as myself and one other guy were bringing up the rear way adrift of the rest of the masses it s a great challenge you should give one a try sometime just read about your k those km markings were shocking you may have run a sub race already cheers for now ppb ppb
hi all just when i had put my thermals away coz the warmer weather had set in i watch the forecast and they tell me there s gonna be snow by the weekend it s no wonder we ve all had colds flu viruses etc etc the wind direction changed suddenly today and the temp dropped or degrees straight away on top of that i ve now joined the injury list with a severe pain on the ball of my left foot right at the base of my middle toe feels like i m walking on a stone all the time if anyone has anything similar and a remedy i d be grateful kattysparke i ll be getting to the expo for registration about on th comig up from east grinstead will be travelling up from three bridges on th if anyone else travelling up from south wants to meet up despite injuries and ailments i m staying positive about the day and really looking forward to it now good to see zimchick and paul made the rw column p s i know somewhere that hires out walking sticks and zimmers should we require them on the day
was your number
hello all i m back um i ve emailed meldy thanks for tracking me down can t have my email working on this site as it s a work address so i probably should n t really be on these forums showboat sorry to hear about your problems have you definitely decided if you re running this year or not i hope this thread has been of some help to you and maybe you could use it as inspiration for next year i felt awful having to defer last year but it s been worth it in the end as i m feeling pretty good now how s everyone else doing hope you re all tapering nicely without any problems it felt so weird on sunday only doing an hour s run this week i ve got a min run tomorrow gym session on wednesday and my final pre race run on friday going for a gentle mins back over the scrubs where my training really started last year i m going to the expo on friday and will try and get there as early as poss to avoid the rush of out of towners on the other hand i may be so excited that i ll go after work on thursday so impatient sorry not to be able to meet up with you shuffler at the expo and not sure if we ll see each other on the day you re a bit faster than me but it s nice to think of you and sezz being on the same team as me i ve decided to set myself tasks for each day this week to keep the nerves at bay today s task is writing and sending off the last of my letters asking for sponsorship it s a bit late but you never know i ve found emailing and writing to people direct has been quite effective nearly everybody has sponsored me and some people have been surprisingly generous total is somewhere around excluding gift aid and my company will add another in a money match scheme so it s looking quite healthy must go before this email turns into an essay days to go
actually
entirely the wrong strategy i know but ran for last night at mhr covered very easily paced miles only a little tightness and tiredness in legs this morning will get along to flm expo this afternoon for leg massage tapering with a vengeance now pasta pasta pasta sleep sleep sleep hydrate hydrate hydrate very short easy recovery runs tonight and tomorrow looking forward to the real thing now
could n t agree more hoorah for um and all the supporters boing
fabric paint and blue peter it is then
greetings all nerves are well and truely in decisions oh boy two pairs of trainers on the go cant decide which to wear all prayers thoughts and best wishes to all s on the forum have a great day and an even better race on sunday you deserve it we all do may be back online in the mornibg but cannot guarentee it look forwards to meeting up before during and after the race and on line afterwards to read all the stories and great achievemnets enjoy
hi fb thanks for that yes i m really looking forward to mb i m not much of a climber at all but did an intro week in the alps last year and mt aspiring in nz at christmas i m going with a climbing company in august did you travel off your own bat
wp thanks i have n t made up my mind where in canada i llbe making my home but i ll be resident there for a while i head off the middle of may rfj has a picture on his lfm story and i m right behind him i have n t found any other pics of the gang alanm is there one of you doing your interview interview
it s easy to jump to the wrong conclusions as i did it s been pointed out to me that some runners and marshals sell their medals and jackets t shirts caps jackets etc and donate the proceeds to charity a club colleague of mine is donating whatever he can get for his staff medal to the dreams come true charity good for him but yah boo to any one who is profiting for themselves
thanks for the stats wardi hmmm there certainly does n t seem to be any logic at all especially if the men s qualifying time remains unchanged despite there being far more men achieving it this would mean that i d have to train even harder to get my qualifying time at berlin in september
if done correctly the reason that you gain weight is because you are storing extra glycogen and glycogen requires water thus the additional weight gain which will be drawn upon very quickly through the race this is also part of the reason you may feel sluggish and heavy at the beginning of the marathon but really good around miles as you have already burnt up some of your stored fuel and are already lighter even if you already run off less carbs than you should you would still benefit from this as you are trying to encourage your muscles to store more glycogen than normal there are a few ways of carbo depletion loading and one of the common ways of doing it is to have days of lower carbs i actually take this to extreme and then do a minute run flat out after a good warm up and then hours of eating a very high carb and low protein fat diet so in fact the days fall very clearly into focus on protein fat for days day of very high carbs and days of normal eating this is less likely to make you feel bloated at the start line normally the distance runner s diet consists of around carbs protein and the balance fat in the carb load week the first days will look more like the atkins diet loads of protein then fat and finally carbs you will know whether you have done it correctly as on day of the depletion you will probably feel like the lightest you have ever been most of this is water loss it s really important that in the carb phase on day you eat the right amount of carbs otherwise you will not load sufficiently as a kg woman who normally eats carb diet this means that in those hours i will eat roughly g of carbs i wo n t overeat calorie consumption that equates to around cals of carbs i have done this as a veggie and it is a lot harder to do it than eating meat it also is pretty hard if you have a sweet tooth but it works
or maybe even working
legless thanks very small field last year was n t it that might put me off do n t really want to be last will see how my running goes over the next few weeks had a lovely relaxing time in your pub yesterday wanted to get out to lunch but somewhere where i do n t come across people i have barred everywhere i look your place was ideal
i m the worst person to ask about luton marathon i think the course is awful i would never do it again some peeps like it tho it is a well organised event
have n t been about for a few days was seeing my aunt ovder the week end quite sad as she s emigrating to australia next month to be near her children who settled out there ages ago she is my last living relative in this country apart from daughters grandson so feel sad to see her go hopefully we will manage to get out to see her seren big hugs i lost my mum over yeara ago now and as with yours it was a mercy in many ways but still really sad i do still miss her now no running for over a week and wimped out tonight too as it is so wet windy hippo hope you can get something sorted soon and start your break you obviously need some time to relect and make decisions welcome back jj
like you say swanny bring it on but not too quickly please
nothing cashed over weekend so th time failure for me just to rub salt in the wound both my mates who entered first time have got in so unimpressed
hi rejections in last years for me too oh well had already got other locally lined up one in march or one in may so not too bothered and can still train with others that got in ss
hi all i will be running flm for the disabilities trust a charity that provides essential services to people with autism brain injury profound learning difficulties and physical disabilities i ran flm for them as a golden bond runner they are only a small team but they are really helpful with trainning and support and need all the help that they can get from sponsorship i was lucky enough to get in through the ballot this year so to show my gratitude ill be fund raising again if you have a place and would like to raise money for the trust i know that they would be more than welcoming please let me know if you can help thanks andy
and i m still deaf in one ear
judging my your post i think you need a bit better finger control with that rubber one i ve not tried a rubber one but i do have a black one here at work its actually a bit sticky at the moment too shirl the week after next i will be expecting even more out of you practise makes perfect well done x
where do you all find the time
we let ladies in our group as well morticia although they have to be voted in by the thread team and there are certain attributes that they must have you are more than welcome to make a guest appearance despite not being voted in
well done to everyone who managed their long runs in the bad weather this weekend i struggled through slow wet and muddy miles the cold bath at the end of it all did n t seem as cold as last week as i was frozen right through already
bedders do n t apologise for wearing different colour specs from me i ve done this race three times and the start has been delayed each time very annoying i m with you there i ve just found that the positives outweigh the negatives that s all we tend to major on organisation when we assess races and of course that s important but there are other factors to think about yes i remember that there were complaints about the buses but i ve always driven there and have n t experienced that myself the race itself feels like a big event which is why i think it s good preparation for london insofar as anything can prepare you for london bottled water energy drinks big field tons of marshals good crowd support town centre running finish in a high profile stadium i ve never had any trouble getting my medal or buying a teeshirt the thing about reading is i think they genuinely try to improve the event year on year they keep switching the route and the date to try to improve it and i respect that
some fantastic mileage being run out there keep it up guys just got back from my ended up doing very windy on the way back bit of sleet thrown in for good measure managed the run in hours and minutes probably a bit fast but felt ok i used some gels for the first time sis orange flavour reminded my of sweet semolina yum yum not seemed to keep me going though so i think i ll stick with em i bought a specific waist belt to carry them in nice and slim did n t even notice it on the run need to practice getting them out though nearly ran into a telegraph pole whilst trying to get one out doh enjoy your sunday evenings hm
work means i only manage runs a week midweek of miles and then a long run on a sunday i m up to miles now and doing tomorrow it s the midweek runs that are hard this week my miler was b y hard work every step was an effort every hill was like everest i did last sunday steady in hr min can i still do hr min i m beginning to doubt it need some encouragement or some advice on how to train smarter
forgot to say get well soon tootie and if there s coffee going free in hopkinton then count me in
pinks well done at milton keynes i was there too was my first m i must admit i found the wind around the lake very difficult to run in makes you feel like you are n t going anywhere at least the weather was alot better than predicted good luck everyone at silverstone and liverpool
who got the biggest pb yesterday i know mr simmons whacked minutes off anybody on here beat that the stockport harriers how much did they shave off their half marathon pb going off their own watch chart gingerbreadman seconds witgb seconds
itc could n t agree more i never dreampt of even competing in a marathon months ago so getting to the end will be one hell of an achievment i know i seem to have caught the running bug so i hope that i will continue running way past april rd thanks for the inspiration
a convent somewhere up a nepalise mountain mountain
think my feet ankles have had enough of marathon training did a fast ish miles last night and hobling around on a new injury today right ankle ca n t really pinpoint it just sore walking on it that alone running not doing anything till mile oakly race on sunday and hope for the best i do n t think i m designed for marathons but i m determined to get round somehow
andrew i agree with karen and jej run the half at mp but you have to be sure that you wo n t end up racing i ran a half at marathon heart rate weeks before london last year and it was a real morale booster for me because it demonstrated that my target time was acheivable
hi everyone sounds like we are all on a high hope everyone s last lsr was a good un did an miler yesterday just missed the major downpours walked the first half cos of knee problem then the second half i tried the pose method of running just to see it was a miracle no knee pain at all and i was doing min miles i ve never run that fast ever went back to my normal running style as an experiment for min and knee instantly hurt again so i m sticking with this method for london can anyone recommend so ok tasting energy gels tried the sis ones and they were disgusting they had n t been anywhere near an orange and the consistency was what i can only imagine eating frog spawn would be like ok i have a vivid imagination well done everyone on your hard work so far and enjoy the taper weeks weeks
aa nice job great run hm very impressive well fdone on all the long runs peeps you all seem to be cruising in to the taper modes not quite sure if peeekay is though i think he may need to consider a taper or take care folks
my running number is maybe i will see you there not dressing up i m going to struggle getting round as it is i am running for breast cancer campaign i was thinking about wearing a bra over my shirt argh so close now
busy week at work but now demob ed till after flm spending the next week visiting family in the south west so i might not get connected to the intermeweb for a while run well people thanks for the support and camaraderie keep smilin and be proud
easy easy easy
defo for shorts it ll be very warm in the crowds bike style shorts for people worried about chafing and lots of bodyglide t shirt or vest top only too
did the flm in and loved it or rather loved finishing it said never again and had changed my mind by the following wednesday anyway after years of rejections nice watch and a huge rainjacket i was accepted for this year and got on with my training although i have been quite enthusiastic and the training has been ok i must admit that it was n t the same as the first time i just did n t seem to have the same sense of excitement which i guess is understandable as i d wanted to run the marathon since i d first seen the early races on tv a good example is that last time i pretty much lived on this forum whereas this time i was just dropping in and out and consequently missed the support group stuff must pay more attention anyway this week the nerves have hit me big time and i m really struggling to focus on anything else i m trying to be excited as well but to be honest am a bit all over the place and ca n t really think of much else at the moment any non virgins experienced out there experienced this best of luck to all of you watch out for me in my welsh flag running vest
last post before the big day as i have an early start in the morning cannot belive we have nearly reached the end of this long journey the training has been great except for the first two weeks of taper have meet some great people during training and have been surprised by how generous people can be when you push a sponsor form under their nose also the number of people who have stopped me and wished me luck not forgetting what a great time i have had reading and adding to this thread over the last five months have really enjoyed reading your comments cant wait to read the stories next week good luck to you all hope you all achive what you deserve from your hard work and most of all enjoy the day
i have only just seen this message i was there this year
ran my hm at a hilly watford so i agree a soft target re abingdon i was n t going to bother with trying for a sub as it has never really been a goal of mine but i ll do it just for you to make you happy happy
the future father in law is desperate to get my folks to dish the dirt good lord we are having an italy paty here tonight cos the boys are all coming round for the football and one of mr kp s mates grandparents are itailan tenous but there you are
dn thanks for the words of encouragement i suppose that i do n t count my vienna effort in the same light as the other marafuns as my target was as opposed to sub for the others i am very pleased with my negative splits for vienna though mins running on grass for me last night oh the long road to recovery
manage another today once i got out the dor veyr nice and once my mind was numbed to toe pain i enjoyed run adn even downhill was not too bad will try tomorrow me thinks hoping to get up to by sunday leicester definitely on now claire make sure you recuperate well weight before rhm i was st after and after a fair bit of rehydrtaion i was st now i seem to have got back to st concluson extra lbs of muscle can t possibly have overdone refuelling
brilliant nicks well done you have really come back stronger after being so poorly no way i will be able to keep up with you come flm lol rio i m confused how do i know what i did wrong last year and how did you know it was the long runs i did couple of s couple s and a for this year i just felt tired on the start line and felt grotty around miles but after that i felt better and could have run a lot more but just did n t really get going again
ms raptor best wishes for abingdon i did my now weekly mile solo run yesterday and was slightly peeved that my pacing without technology was marginally off and my time was hour and not like last weeks i guess i ve gotten used to always improving my times but for a training run i should be happy that it s now a regular thing and not a monumental challenge anymore the plan for glen clova half is to collar someone of experience who has a bleepy thing so i can attack the mins target pidge your photo did n t do you justice either i had you down as a white van man in his forties anyway good luck with barnes green it should n t be too hot for you find someone beforehand who plans a similar pace to you and smash your pb when those gazelle genes kick in from mile onwards just do n t bring up your job if you like a chat going round ha ha i am gonna experiment with these wee sis gels that mr dap swears by at glen clova if it can give me a wee boost to maintain my pace hrr i have big plans for you in the winter months ahead so soak your feet in vinegar like a pair of conkers and fingers crossed you ll be back soon amanda z hullo good luck in stroud think i ve been there when i lived in bristol take it easy and think only of good things never giving negative thoughts any space in your head i ve not looked at any training plans yet feeling that the higher my long run can be come christmas the better i ll have less ground to make up in so might actually enjoy it instead of it being the most hellish or weeks of my life qq does the bloke off blues clues on nick jnr still sing the bedtime business song at pm a classic may have asked this before but if i m ft stone and have run maybe miles this year is it ok to wait for santa to bring me a new pair of n a halfs
given they claim to automatically mail out marathon news to those previously rejected i have a bad feeling about my times rejected application this year they ve only mailed it out for past years had to go looking for it before then have cheques stubs bank statements available plus list of the thanks for bequeathing gifts of which are still in use have never found the helpline all that helpful maybe i just get folk who are having a bad day
hi all changing subject totally gutted today as actually dropped out of my k race after k started strong then unbelievably right hamstring cramped out pretty much out of the blue i stopped and stretched it started up again but it hurt like so i stopped now i wonder whether i could have kept going was the seizing psychological because it does n t feel so bad now first time i ve even started a race and dropped out what a horrible feeling but i guess it s all part of being a runner in general i think i m putting too much mental pressure on myself over race results which is silly because it s not like i m even at elite level as an amateur from now on i think i might start thinking of races as training runs with a bit of company i also think i need to race more so that each one does n t seem like such a big deal anyway really disappointed so if anyone s got any good jokes or anything anything
good advice to take a mobile with you mine plays mp s and i know i can always use it to call a taxi in case if injury keep the volume low or you ca n t hear the traffic wear something reflective so you can be seen even with streetlights it amazing how invisible you are without hi viz gear and remember other people are probably more scared of you than you are of them imagine how you would feel if you were out at night walking and heard the sound of someone running towards you the worst i ve had is being egged by a goup of teenage morons from a car i was heckled by a group of adolescents once but asked them to run to the top of the hill with me as you can guess they all dropped out exhuasted after a couple of hundred yards yards
i ve yet to hit an easy patch in a marathon hippo s spot on with her advice as usual my big mistake in my first mara was not having carbo loaded enough and i ran out of fuel too early not pleasant
hippo ouch hope you re ok call a doctor
sf is roobarbs partner at work only ot ehrwise kbown as spannerb tchbumfface
happy new year all thanks for the comments bambina and kayvee my back is still not quite right no pain anymore but just feels uncomfortable under my right shoulder like a muscle is trapped or knotted or something think i will give my old physio a shout better to get it sorted out sooner rather than later i ve been off running for the last couple of days anyway my first hangover of has reached a second day of suffering read more in my flm training blog at http www whtimes co uk flatfiles weblogs chris lennon aspx
darren i will also be looking for at wokingham and will see if is possible at fleet or reading to push for may not be a good idea at this early stage in training wokingham is a good fast course last year was windy very wet and cold so you should not have too many problems just after the start i would suggest to stay on the path if it s been raining and if running on the grass could be a bad move it s not too long before gaps start to appear and can then settle into your pace
managed to get up early this morning to get speed session out of the way x mile at km h with mins rec found it very difficult especially the hill i have to run up on the way back from the gym
reb mm just want to reinforce what the others are saying when i did my first marathon training i ran too soon after having a chest infection and ended up with pneumonia i ran because i did n t want to put a dent in my training but ended up writing myself off for weeks afterwards that said i still managed to catch up you ve still got plenty of weeks to slowly build up the long runs especially if you re not going for a particular time in many ways your first marathon gives you that extra bit of freedom that you re going to get a personal best regardless good luck
i reckon i was approaching wall state actually more of a garden boundary sized wall but the pace definitely dipped at the end as i climbed the final hills sorry remember i m an aspirant still not an achiever yet
typical that i mistype the word that is bold so it stands out
aorn i hope you re out there blasting away your hangover now good news on your shin qq o gentle miler for me this morning too to find out whether i could run in my new sorbothane insoles they were fine i m not a morning runner and never really warmed up but my shin did n t make too much fuss fuss
tr sounds like you re aiming to beat my bramley time i do n t think i would recommend racing miles as i did i managed it because i was already well conditioned x milers in jan and x in feb before bramley for example
i did a mile race on sunday mins i am a bit concerned about the number of long runs people have done i have been following a rw schedule for sub and have only done x and x i do have x and x and x before hope this is ok i am still not cofident of being able to do mm for lm for miles was ok but couldnt do it for any more m getting worried again
morning everyone i have posted this before on another thread sorry rio but thought it might be of interest to you word to the wise for those who are treading the roads of london for the first time on race day just think legs what i hear you say think about it you get out of bed you have to travel to the start you may well have had to take the train you have to walk from the station to the start area now your nervous and you are walking around looking for friends or charity areas you go to the loo and stand in a queue you have a coffee still standing you change and then at last you go to your start pen what sill minutes to go and your still standing yippeee the gun goes of hang on you havent moved it could take anything up to minutes before you actualy cross the start line then you have to run so the moral of the story is keep off your feet as much as possible on race day take an old shirt jacket bin bag anything to sit on wherever you can if you dont you will wish you had trust me i learnt the hard way good luck everyone enjoy your day
hi all just popped by to say i am in no way jealous of you lot doing the flm not at all not even a bit no sir not on your nelly face bovvered am i bovvered not bothered at all honestly really
caro its not that sort of a massage if you are in pain it is just to take some of the knots out of your legs and not relaxing at all stiffness is all part of the marathon unfortunately it really does hurt a lot and it cant be avoided some grit and determination is needed roz some people carry deep heat with them to rub in when it gets tough or the muscles cramp too much might be worth thinking about rather than adding an extra layer
howdy i went to the gym again and my foot is still holding up going to try and run for a little longer on it tomorrow morning to see how i get on fingers crossed hope mrs ps get s better soon tracey tell bernard well done from me although through gritted teeth cos hippo s right it just is n t fair lyndy good news from you let s hope you re well and truly on the mend
show off
morning all tr you ve got to rest up you are only delaying the recovery geewok fingers crossed at least you know what the problem is now ww i m planning on doing the miler as a progression run starting off at around s and winding up the last mile at projected mp dan whats the plan s
ws i m not sure that mile reading is correct as my hrm has been playing up a bit and i wonder if it got confused with other hrm s and telly signals etc the first mile was v slow so i think it could be wrong having said that my hr was definitely shooting up when i was still in the queue for a wee with mins to go before the start
more like for the cd this time wd
i like others have already said ran with my own ml bottle at the start when empty i discarded the bottle but kept the sports valve lid and just screwed it onto the next bottle i got i was able to do stations per bottle but still found there was nothing at thru then only intermittent supply to the end im not sure whose fault it is i suspect it s of one and half a dozen of the other flm should have put more on but likewise faster runners perhaps should have bene limited in the amount they can take i dunno i aint pointing fingers guess in a sense it adds to the challenge of it all
i did a silly thing with my and set mine to marathon distance i only bought it days beforehand and is shut off at miles with minutes to go up till then it was running about a half mile extra it says garmin can be up to accurate but given the several tunnels we had to go through canary wharf and isle of dogs etc not surprised people are out by so much i d rather it was telling me i was slower than actual than faster than actual looking forward to using the training programmes from this site with it once i ve recovered recovered
lol tr my legs look more like sticks of celery poking out of a carrier bag swim was in some school pool really wierd as you do lengths per lane then get out and do more carnege for shite swimmers like me nice running jakesy i was out at am this morning for miles at pace not fast or hard but nterestingly my avghr was only
i forgot to add london chest hospital k to my list am hopefully taking a group of brownies to the mile fun run on the same day am going to chat to them about my marathon run and having lost lots of weight although the emphasis will be on being healthy and not losing weight
lt pushes the door open one last time hi minni i ran at lochaber which was a pb by mins i use my hrm on every run although the battery packed up during the marathon itself typical windsurfin susie over on the hard training thread has far more technical hrm training knowledge that i do so it might be worth sticking your head in there for me i religiously kept the vast majority of my runs to of my working heart rate hrmax i now know what the different efforts feel like and do n t need to check my watch very often hrm training has certainly improved my sense of pacing almost always i run by effort and by time on feet not pace so for example my tempo runs include say mins at m effort rather than a m speed and a typical long run will be something like hr min at whr rather than an exact mileage this approach allowed me to ramp up my mileage to mpw at peak without injury overtraining i ran every day for over months from last september until the taper without problems having spent the preceeding weeks off injured and not running at all in the last weeks of training i made the switch over to quicker running trying to hit specific paces increasing the speed on long runs etc which brought me nicely to a peak i reckon the best thing about an hrm though is on recovery days where it gives you permission to run slow as slow as m m sometimes even slower i m a complete convert to active recovery now rather than taking rest days it s all useful mileage my average pace during the whole training period was only m m very little speed work at all but despite this my eventual marathon pace averaged m m with a slight ve split and my m and k times came also improved hrm training takes patience though initially most people have to slow right down and that can be hard psychologically so it s not everyone s idea of fun but if you re going to give it a go i reckon spring summer s the perfect time to do it a good intro book is heart rate monitor training for the compleat idiot by john l parker lt closes door on way out
mike you posted a few pages back a recommended schedule post marathon to keep things going before the next marathon training block autumn seems to have vanished any chance of posting it again cheers
gobi youda man without the skinny one with the funny gait to hold you back you re bound to nail it have a good weekend kids as you were then
glad its not just mine susan maybe howard will help us out with some of his wise words
ah that ceilidh was rocking do you know it finished ish yes a few did the whole thing and mara at then end too i think k and loon dod both did the lot i went back to bed at a bout though i felt so miserable lets just say as well as wooden left leg i had totm and was sitting at the meal struggling to talk smile or anything best at home when i feel like that i think hubby is number following me in on the beach run i am carrying our mates camera because they both thought it a good idea to jump into the sea before we finished it is a fun event the beach one you have to guess your time and the nearest to it wins one of our friends got it spot on and i was secs
oh dear not a good last few hours for bw today and nn yesterday afternoon i would say i hope you kicked his ass bw but does n t sound like you d want to put your foot there hope the weekend gets better for you two i m sure the theraputic running helps can t complain other than being at work a few hours to kill then off to beverley races and no silver ring or tatts for me today i get to lord it up with owners and trainers for the afternoon what what leaving the running to the horses today at least hopefully harvest warrior will do us proud again and make it two wins in two though i m not sure if the ground is soft enough this horse is more x country than road race
i m an all the gear cyclist so if i am out i do n t really care about the weather i know when doing tri my running never got worse while i was cycling and running less i have noticed this year that although i do little or no cycling i can still manage mph for an hour on the bike and then get off and run downside is my bum hurts due to lack of riding
oh my god look at rh and i s forum posts what a couple of wasters we are tee hee managed mins on saturday bit fed up as it was incredibly hard work i just ca n t seem to get back into it at the moment hey ho i guess body is not quite there so i ll continue to cross train ahead of my hols just over a week to go excited me never
oh gatton no you do n t have to do that pinks i d like to do it in hours i m not sure that s realistic though
just repeated last saturdays miler on my loop i came out about a minute slower overall spread through the sections very happy with this one and a great way to bring up the mile week racing easy plod around the downlands miler tomorrow i will not be rushing
a comment was made about not having a gb charity place the first time you do the marathon i disagree as people really see it a challenge the first time you do it and appreciate that it is really something hard that you have never done before because of this i found people quite willing to sponsor me i m not sure that i would get the same response if i did it again as they would know that i had completed it once i had a fundraising target of i managed to raise i did start fundraising in december with a christmas raffle and did a few other activities as well as asking for sponsorship the company where i work also gave me some sponsorship it can be done you just have to be willing to ask a lot of people
what did you expect it to do do
cheers ah susan for kind words good thing was when i got back to my car there was an ice cream parked opposite p spring mara for me does n t appeal to be honest as spent so much of this year training might go back to ks etc had lady at club on wednesday chasing me for this years x country even thought of gsr at the moment is not attractive better flippin get that sub at budapest or i will be doing another one wo n t i right as if not had enough punishment for one day now off to get legs waxed ouch
sad bored delia today i ve had to call in sick got no voice ca n t swallow ca n t eat ca n t breathe very well yuk yuk yuk got the quacks in a bit but i m already bored out of my tiny mind
unfortunately odeon is n t that impressive for a wheelchair athlete
ww sorry about removing you on the training plan i was n t suggesting that would be it for the week they are just the key sessions i reckon on the mp training some of the medium long run might be at mp and some of the ends of the long runs i ve never done much mp training because i find your options are do m at mp in a longer run which is basically what i suggested above do m at mp i find this really hard and can barely manage it without entering a hm race i usually do this a few weeks before the marathon e g m easy warm up straight into the hm at mp i do n t want to start a fight but i m not a fan of running at mp in training
tell him you promise not to run whilst you re in the pub sorted
hi all bootsie i hope your leg feels better soon i know its easy to say try not to rush it but in your mind the event gets nearer maybe some long walks will ease you back into it topsec i can imagine how annoyed you feel about flm losing your entry i was very lucky this year i know and of course i would have accepted rejection but losing the so many entires seems very careless indeed ran miles this evening the first went pretty well but my legs then felt very heavy did but the miler on sunday will be much slower pace
p s nice cartoon in the december edition of prospect magazine i thought some of you on here who share my anti fat and the population is being seduced by food and car manufacturers views might enjoy a stout man is seated at a desk in shirt and tie on the desk is a sign bearing the legend immigration on the other side is a thin man at whose feet are several suitcases the text below the picture says you re in luck we re very short of thin people people
some great long runs going on i wish our county xc was on the saturday so i could have bagged one but never mind had a reasonably good race came in th but given the opposition i could n t have come any higher up and would have been very disappointed to come any lower down there was about a s gap in front and behind me which enabled me to enjoy the last lap a bit more it was probably the hardest course i ve ever run on i reckon i was n t faster than min mile up one particular hill and it was n t that short and we had to do it three times three main hills on each lap and very muddy for about of the lap think we just lost out to coro s team for the win but did n t hang around to find out anyway a good workout and i ve been offered a place in the team for the intercounties so a good afternoon out all in all coro and edb probably had more interesting races so i ll let them recount their tales ed in particular had a pretty eventful run marders i ll be at the fred hughes but marshalling we host the race i think jej said he would be doing it but that was a while back so may have changed
last night at the track we did a session into the wind of course of x mins with min recovery quite a tough little session and it definitely made me puff and blow o this morning was a mile run into work on the icey pavements and road which was an adventure i was skidding and skating all over and had to head for the grass verge to stay upright on a few occasions so forgot the time and concentrated on making it in one piece tomorrow is a rest day as i have a league xc race at whitby on sunday feel cold just thinking about it
i m going to do the hotel switch today mind you lot sound as though you ll be miles ahead
i do n t think it is cheating really if you run against the virtual runner on the watch is that not smilar to a pace maker which most top distance races have these days anyway
wardi just pops in to say i too found the wind just a tad much today i could cope with running into the wind and hardly moving it was being dragged up a hill by the force of the gales near a main road and having no control over my legs cut short my run after miles too hope it s calmed down for my miler on sunday enjoy your weekend and your rest day in particular
hello boys and girls lots of good running going on and lots of good banter who are all of you people anyway just got back in from my trip to the smoke had a good run this morning from pimlico to birdcage walk and the mall raised my hand s in victory as i crossed the finish line in the morning and no one was looking ran towards trafalgar sq took a left to run along the embankment but got lost and ended up in birdcage walk again and ran past the finish line again then found the river and finished off my miles just observations it s very very flat well at least compared to up north and secondly nobody says hello to you when they run again very different from up here looking forward to the snow in a few days that ll stuff the training
ohamd not any better i was going to go out today as the weather was so good in the midlands but as it was cold and i still have the sniffles and a cough i decided not to risk it if i had i know i would have been out of action for another week or so it seems to take ages to get rid of a cold when you get older i think the plan for the next week is out of the window and when i can get back running it will just be getting some miles in hope the rest of you keep away from the colds etc
ltsa i think you are spot on about not getting injured but pushing you just enough and of course enjoying the run are you used to running that pace cause i will need someone to keep me on track although i will have my trusty mostly garmin with me
take some tissues and try not to make your issues the main thing on your mind all the time relax and hopefully enjoy it is a beautifull day today for running
great run benyo it sounds lovely down there i managed my miles at least or miles were straight into the teeth of the wind however i did n t feel as bad as i thought i would even though uphill into the wind is n t my favourite occupation completed in hrs min so i was really quite pleased as its a hilly route now i m shattered though so i m laid on the couch watching the rugby something strange has happend to my left foot along the outside edge at the bottom it has developed a big red black bruise during my run did n t hurt as i ran and does n t hurt now anyone any ideas i know i m overdue for new shoes but keep putting it off as these are like an old pair of slippers now hope you all enjoy the rest of the weekend i m routing for your mum benyo
hail hail confess to preferring the hour stint option purely cos i aint got the reall speed in my legs but stamina i m ok but i ll defer to the majority opinion nts quick question i ve been looking at flights due to family commitments it would be better for me to get a friday morning flight down is this going to be a big problem if i m not there for the start i d prefer to be in all the photos obviously but is it crucial
lol tt my kid brother is this year took miles to catch you at wokingham tr as usual i would say something different to the others and suggest you did a progressive run with only about miles late on at planned mp but thats just me planned mp easy if you can run between and with relative ease you will be able to run a sub marathon
evening everyone did llanelli today madwelsh it was nice to meet you too sorry we did n t get much time to chat but i guess after a hard race is n t the best time anyway i was feeling really nauseous at that point that s the second time i ve felt sick after a hm has anyone else experienced that my hm pb is but i only managed today which actually on the back of all the hard work we ve been doing lately is n t that bad i guess it was really windy too the training must be paying off though because i m not as stiff and sore as when i did lake vyrnwy half shame they re not doing that this year tis a lovely race sd that vid made me all emotional too as for all the niggles i ve a few that come and go i ve suffered with pf for ages now but it only seems to affect me when i ve been inactive for a while it does n t stop me running it band i m aware of it but as soon as i get a twinge and this goes for all my other niggles i have a sports massage i m covered in bruises but they seem to do the trick good look for the coming week everyone
brian very short term plan is to get out of work as early as possible today pm finish on tuesday wednesday and thursday has left me cream crackered and i need to go to the gym as only exercise this week has been x miles m m which is hardly top end stuff in terms of training plan is to introduce some short and fairly gentle speedwork next week so that my runs of miles each week are something approaching quality work and to do longer lower hr sessions in the gym then i ll test the waters with either a k or a leg of the midlands road relays the first weekend in april and take it from there i m probably being over cautious gobi would be proud but having been in pain even walking for days i m scared of pushing things now better safe than sorry and all that
geoff m just read back that you are starting at blue start think you may be a bit quick for me tho i m going to try and find the sub pace maker and stick like glue how about you will you pace youself
thanks wa lt wanders off to find thread to add own angst gt
hi everybody good to see you are all doing well keep it up had quite a hectic week so ive only managed a mile hill session at gym on tuesday and two miler on friday and today but ill just keep plodding on busy at work next week we have the cheltenham gold cup races going on at our hotel lots of irish spending there hard earned cash on the horses ill see if i can get any good tips off them i purchase some new trainers back in jan and ive now done mile in them does anybody think i should get some more now ready for april take cake all mark
gd just replied to your thread yep he was going quickly and yes i m sure that last mile was at least two
lardarse are those your legs to the question do they look like women s legs my answer is have you met my wife you seem to have a thing for shiny medals tutu hopefully swimming and long taper will get rid of whatever it is you have before doctor gets round to finding it eastham it was susan who asked if you were lardarse not me lardarse is on fetch so i know he is not you and you are n t him him
picked up a calf niggle on last night s run was still hoping to do tonight s planned track session but after a gentle mile warm up it was feeling worse not better so decided to skip it do n t think it s anything too serious just a bit of tightness i hope probably caused by the faster than normal miler on sunday not long to go now tr i ve just about had enough of the high volume and endless long runs too quite looking forward to having a few easy weeks after flm then targeting something shorter
thanks for the pics lep recorn i think it looks like there could still be enough room though we have to bear in mind other members of the public will need to be able to get past us what does anyone else think
hi this is my first post so go easy i ve been training for the flm my first marathon since december and looking for a sub as i have stuck to my weekly garmin training for that time this week is supposed to be my hardest week miles with a miler run this weekend however i have picked up a couple of minor injuries and dont know what to do first injury i have recently been getting knee pains which i think is runners knee i have tried to keep my training up only missing a few short runs so far i have also started running with a knee starp which helps until i finish when i get a bit of pain second injury i m not sure what this injury is but dont think it relates to my training i ve had it before some time ago it s a pain in the arch of my foot when i m walking it s not bad at the moment but i m guessing that it might get worse an end up as a sharp pain in the arch the irritating thing about this is that i brought it on today when i went shopping with some new trainers on not running trainers i have spoke to other people about this non runners too and they also say they have had it from new shoes trainers i was hoping that while i taper my running over the next few weeks my injuries would get better but dont want to stop training yet if i can help it any suggestions thanks
actually friday would be ideal the relatives might appear on saturday

its my intention to achieve a gfa time in the next twelve months i have various half ironman distance triathlons until september and then intend to try and put the training time into running over the winter period crack the gfa time as i am now early next year and then concentrate on triathlons again knowing i can enter flm or ny etc without the hassle of ballots
i have a hang over today first since my birthday on nd january cant cope with them these days back on the wagon tonight we just had a couple of friends round for a takeaway curry and there was some champers left from people bringing it over post flm and so i set out to drink it and then some wine when it was finished had a heated argument about ken vs boris for london mayor and woke up feeling like s e
marders you never know with me about the mms but i can confirm that tom is not my brother but the similarity has been noticed padams rach says well done to you
bej good to hear it s clearing up i d hazard a guess that your embarassingly slow pace is still quicker than anything i m doing
tony and mcallister who attended the game spent the second half on the bog crapping himself all being well i shall be at wembley wearing my askern m teeshirt second m ld the regents park run i refered to was round the outside albeit the uphill anticlockwise route other london parks i ve run round include st james hyde green battersey richmond bushey ravenscourt paddington rec primrose hill hampstead heath hainault woods wimbledon common ruislip woods and ealing common oh and wormwood scrubs and one two weeks ago whose name i forget best wishes from south lincolnshire where we do n t have parks
rb think i ll be up for sat evening food and you ve got some knowledge of decent places to go i would imagine however it will be me plus girlfriend also running the marathon and parents not running assuming they re all welcome good to hear the course is reasonably sheltered although they ve changed their mind now and reduced the wind slightly but it s coming from the other direction dull you must be reasonably pleased with that if it was n t a full on effort race report from me th in ish minute first k and ish second k very pleased with my restraint which was helped by running with a clubmate also doing edinburgh it was fun flying past people in the last km obviously i m not able to disclose coro s result
daz you forgot about the all venomous critters scorpions snakes etc out there i d leave that one to bear grylls he likes eating scorpions for breakfast sandstorms too and it gets bloody cold at night night
happy birthday ltsa had a brilliant day yesterday and managed a pb completed the half marathon in hrs and mins very proud of myself my relay partner did it in hrs flat on her first race so overall i think we were done in hrs for the whole marathon i saw shades going around and she looked tired but doing great very very hot day there and some hills that got the better of me hills to me anyway but most fun race i ve done and very proud to do it at home home
intervals today which i was a bit sceptical about one mile wu cd with x around bushey park with recoveries for the s quite hard work by the third one but got through it ok the hr was up to around so still a bit lower effort than i should be putting in for interval but although sore the leg and foot were fine throughout which was the main thing thing
wt will be thinking of you today i spoke at my sister funeral i knew i could n t not and although tough to do it helped to have happy moments to talk about and made getting through the day more bearable i hope you can help give her the send off she deserved
hail hail why am i not surprised
same here sb i think yesterday s heat surprised a few people even up here i did a k and found it hard work then straight to pj s football match where we found a kid s triathlon taking place with a cycle course across our pitch so off to the opposition s pitch where we got beat including a robinsonesque howler from pj liverpool failed to beat stoke chelsea failed to beat man u after all that the k results were up and on top of being seconds slower than my last race on my watch they have got me down as seconds slower than my watch time on the positive macc half next week followed by congleton the week after after
multiple x posts for me must be really slow brian nice track session have to say not looking forward to the on a weekday i probably wo n t be able to start until pm as well mtr sorry to hear the not so good track session rm bugger good luck with the new mission
it s tricky is n t it
tt my best opportunity to have run a mara would have been i know it s not when i were a lad but it s still long enough ago for me to get misty eyed about it i d had months at mpw an hm of but no long runs over m so i reckon i would have breezed it to m thereafter i m not sure now i ve got several dodgy bits that just ca n t cope with the pounding to the extent that yesterdays m has given reason for concern my september stats are miles ave pace max week miles min week miles rest days races wins well sort of if you exclude the under s in front of me
just read back congrats and commiserations in equal measures all round sorry for not posting but i ve been a bit busy and now have a cold
lol thomas will be very toasty the baby jogger has a muff and a rain cover too not sure about the pb though ha ha good luck hippo with your k
erm erm
sorry blisters the head won our road was an ice rink but once you got onto the more main roads it was fine so i might have to put this down as a missed opportunity suffice to say that minutes on a bike this morning and various parts of me feel as though they re about to fall off with the cold
on the subject of projecting mara times off half m s i do know of a couple of ladies who have broken only just off a half time of i do n t know of any blokes that have done it however which rather re inforces my theory that girlies are slightly better suited to long distance running the simple fact is that the quicker you can run your half m s mile races etc then the more comfortable sub pace will feel on marathon day i tend to do or mile runs in the build up the longest usually add up to about miles i have found the midweek mid long runs of miles have also improved my performances in the last couple of years in line with ex pat s thinking i try not to do mile runs on consecutive weekends if at all possible lorenzo my in was the last time i failed to break being only mins adrift should give you confidence aplenty to have a good go at it next time m run home last night about m with the club tonight tonight
intervals done actually really quite enjoyed them how bizarre the poxy hrm is bonkers though i think it worked at the start then gave it up maybe because its scared of the readings anyway the vital statistics for those who so like them go a little something like this distance m time pace mi average hr bpm our easy bits came in at about mi our intervals mi except for the last one which was up hill and so was mi not bad now i need a serious dunk in a hot bath will try not to fall asleep and drown
does anyone know if there s somewhere to find out what time you predicted for yourself i ca n t remember at all whether i said or or do i just need to wait and see which pen they ve allocated me to i never thought for a moment that i d actually get in through the ballot but now i ve got a place i ve committed publicly to trying to get
i am following the schedule too om but not so rigorously i am doing lsr the two longer midweek runs plus one run with our group usually a thursday which is usually or intervals of around a mile and a half but there is dedicated speed session and a hill session too in rotation but i find i have to hold back a little or i get overtired and i ususally miss the saturday run so it could be argued that i m not really following it at all really just back from miles in an easy hour and off for a shin saving cold shower before a meal and dvd with mrs puffy puffy
br you are a x machine mate nice jock great run mate race report today th place oxford mail league cross country learned this year that i am not that slow so have started going off a lot harder settled in around th place always a few flamers on the st lap moved up a few places and started the nd lap just around the top and racing chaps working well we all took another place and then i got ahead of the worked the climb and headed out onto lap with a small gap in th place pushed hard into the wind to try to force a gap gave myself a stitch it worked well and i recovered in the trees and headed for home all in all a good run and the best bit my knees feel fine worst part about todays xc was all the ribbing about the picture and article in runners world even people who do n t always talk that much ribbed us both
sarah what a great run today you must be pleased to get that out of the way with a lot of us doing our lsr s tommorrow great time as well i aiming to be at at hrs on the day so you are storming it keep it up hardly any snow in hull this week so managed shorter road runs and now getting focused for a miler tommorrow morning but its freezing cold outside already and forecast for minus first thing cant say i am looking forward to the first or miles skins on the radiator tonight emily can you send any nec routes to me i am there at a show at the end of feb and need an excuse to escape the bar and to down a third or fourth sparkling mineral water god it can be boring sometimes being a runner had some second thoughts about the sub on the back of my top as i am worried i might not achieve this on the day but have decided to go for it anyway as i am confident jagman will locate me and carry me to the end if my pace is too slow off for a big bowl of noodles hopefully catch up tommorrow
ode good to catch up yesterday i managed a few more afterwards and ended up with at just under pace for the lot was tooooo cold towars the end though when the proper snow was starting to fall legs like blocks of ice when i d done won t be there this wednesday btw but time and venue is the same you ll get a warm up getting there which is good as last time they went pretty much straigh tin to x minutes on the old railway line off to do an interval session with my club shortly pug you coming out to the half on sunday regardless or only if you get a number
icclesuez hello just cross posted across you sorry well done on the race which one did you do and how did it go
in a nts style i spent the flight back from lisbon doing some hr pace analysis using the fetch beats mile calculation as a good basis and eliminating runs under miles to reduce the effect of the early miles and low hr plus it strips out all the interval sessions i then set a baseline of the first quarter of when i was training for my st marathon and bought an hrm i came up with the following stats q q q q q q q q q which is broadly what i expected steady improvement until march then a dip in fitness with london post london and the summer then a return to form in the autumn quite surprised to see that i m apparently running faster for less effort than a year ago but this quarter is n t done yet and the margin is quite slight improvement in pace hr implies something like mm pace improvement at easy pace from to and from hm pace to about pace pace
nice runs bramley boys just waiting to hear from marders now i think although i m prepared to be impressed marmite wow great time all the sweeter for having had to work so hard to hang in there with the group hard the first time but now that you have broken through to a new level it will get easier and easier i wanted to run the tumbridge wells hm today kent champs but could n t as it filled surprisingly quickly instead i ended up making a longer trip to dover to run a hm there instead with a long w u and c d to make just shy of m an annoyingly hilly second half with a strong head wind made for a very tough slow return did about to half way and then struggled into the wind to come home in clearly all the fast runners were at tw because my time happened to net me the win first time for everything but pleasing given the time in the saddle yesterday now where s my pug ometer m for the week plus just shy of hours swimming and cycling keep em coming coming
ok here is the original plan for this week week how did it get to week already sun rest mon ndash choose an undulating route so that hills are naturally included into the run aim to run for mins with x mins threshold built in this is best run as min easy min threshold repeated throughout try to include the hills naturally but cut the pace and maintain the effort when running up hill let yourself go downhill tues ndash rest but i m going to do monday s run here and rest on monday instead wed ndash pilates as normal thurs ndash group run of mins with the first easy and the last marathon pace fri ndash rest sat ndash hours mins all controlled and relaxed except i ve got the bourton k on sunday and i m not sure just yet how its going to fit in more when i ve spoken to nick
hi all roger very sound advice everyone should follow i ve done the last flms taking a break this year but will be back in with advice from people on this forum thread and its been invaluable half the training is in your mind so i love your run to work and home again suggestion even though i only live miles from work on the short cut i ca n t usually run in as i have to take my boy to school first but this week is half term so i may well give it a go not long to go now then dave do you know its a boy i ll guess at a girl and lb good going caro i had a busy weekend but did k before breakfast on saturday morning and miles at today
it s cold outside no kind of atmosphere we re all alone
help my toenails feel like they are going to fall off does anyone know what i can do to ease the pain the two toes next to my big toe are really sore from the run on sunday they are not totally black but sort of brownish and very sore to touch i have plasters on them to try and cushion from the top of my shoes but am so worried they are going to drop off last nights run was agony not just the toe nails but my heel as well and i had to keep stopping to stretch out very tight calves i do n t think my free sports massage did much good
ff if its any consolation hope i spelt that right mum of ff i had a foot injury this time last year and couldnt put any weight on it rested it for a couple of days and all was fine rest but dont panic wotsit probably shouldnt mention it on here but loving your thread i too am shattered trouble is non running friends and family have no sympathy and come up with helpful sugestions such as take a couple of weeks off ah bless em ttl nothing nicer at this stage of the training plan than speed sessions a week sezz belated thanks for the advice have managed to find a local practicioner from the link you sent now just need to book it
thanks wotsit it s good to know nick s thoughts and that you and tb are doing something similar i know i should have faith as the schedule seems to have been good so far

x post ant two bits of advice if quad is a bit tight and sensitive when i crouch or sit on my haunches do n t more seriously be very careful with anti inflammatories mate had injury in lead up to flm and was taking anti s daily got to about miles and up came all the lucozade and blood and he lost an hour in st johns ambulance lots of tests afterwards found no damage other than temporary thinning of stomach lining but to the anti inflam s all the best jezza

hi all just got back from the expo it was great bit of hassle getting there its so far the other side of london for me it started with the london marathon music as you walked in so that puts you in the right mood and slightly emotional the registration was painless and actually took about a minute as there was no one in my queue lots of different nutrition stands giving out samples bit late to change your race nutrition now but there were some interesting stuff like gel cubes which look like jelly cubes and sort of melt in the mouth and each cube held the same carb value as one gel they come in packs of and are really compact god i sound like i work for them lol look out for them lots of charity stalls and clothing stuff and if you go to the pasta party then you do hear some interesting stuff although i think the price is a little steep and you can hear the same thing if you just stand and watch outside the area my sister wrote a huge good luck wish for me on the adidas wall which was really sweet oh it was all fun and has made it feel even more exciting and scarily close yikes lots of freebies bottle of cranberry sauce in the goody bag which is a little odd free beer stand as well but no use for me in my no alcohol regimen that i am strictly adhering to i hope you all it enjoy as much as i did
sj is not of metcheck says heavy rain for the duration coro i had a stinker yesterday too
getting fed up of trying but i am sticking with it a bit peev ed that the site yesterday said it would be open for the ballot at am and it seems it opened much earlier then crashed getting v frustrated and annoyed now hope the race admin is better
on the recovery side of things pfitzinger and douglas are very strong about not rushing back you have little to gain by rushing back into training and your risk of injury is exceptionally high at this point owing to the reduced resiliency of your muscles and connective tissue after the marathon the recovery schedule starts with days off from running which is the bare minimum of time away from running you should allow yourself if you still have acute soreness or tightness so severe that it will alter your form or if you just do n t feel like running certainly feel free to take more than days off if ever there was a time to lose your marathoner s mind set the week after your goal race is it not running now will increase your chances of being inspired to resume hard training when your body allows it of course some people do n t consider themselves real runners unless they run pretty much every day of their lives plod through a few miles if you must but be aware that you re prolonging your recovery p p d do go on to advocate light cross training such as swimming or cycling and walking
thanks done more disks this morning and have emailed everyone telling them that the runners world email me thing is pants and asking for addresses to flmdvd garrod f co uk if your name is mike steele your blackberry keeps bouncing my emails mail me your details

woony i think eddie was talking about me i tend to plod behind and looked close to death after last saturday sitting here i d love to do but will prob change my mind whilst running especially with those hills
well six of one half a dozen of the other i did say that the pace for the get you round group needs to be about about min miles which if you then take a time based training schedule would give the distance in last years get you round john the penquin bingham came in at hrs mins which is approx min secs mile
this is a great thread and i m so glad that im not going totally crazy and that the flm is consuming other people lives as well between the marathon dreams working out mileage worrying about every little ache or pain thinking about my blisters etc it s a wonder i can fit the training good luck to everyone
if the times were only minutes slower than the men s qualifying times then there just would n t be enough women qualifying sad but true i seem to remember that the championship women s qualifying time used to be hours but was dropped in fairly recent years due to the lack of women qualifying i ve even known the odd woman get a championship place when she has n t got but just over and this never happens for the men in there were approx women in total running the flm compared to men the same goes for the women championship places going off with the elite rather than starting behind them there s only about at the start of the women s race in total whereas there are hundreds of championship male entrants rm hoping to qualify this year for the sub guaranteed future entry time time
i was out all last week feeling rough got back into it on monday doing miles so i would say you d be ok
if anyone wants a laugh apart from watching the cricket check out the brazilian or hollywood thread on ufrc page

had a good miles in so feeling good for the day now one more long run next week then ease up at last
i will when i move to stourbridge they sound really friendly unfortunately the cardiff club was too fast for me and think that min miles is walking
i really ca n t see something like this being a target can t think of any precedents for attacks on sporting events like this hardly likely to win any sympathy for their cause
www charity marathon org uk com incentive this is the site but i think you will be too late for a gold bond place there was a deadline for the entries entries
i take it before i start my runs i did think of trying it about then too no opinion to offer on the danger though
i m putting fatbutfit on mine hopefully other forumites will recognise me
yeah

if you have name on front and back run on outside of the main runners the crowd will see you and give you that pick me up you may need down themall last year the crowd lifted me of my feet and glided me across the line it rearly does help
thanks for your advice i ve decided to scrap any notion of doing the diet i was dreading having to do it anyway sine i had a bad marathon experience the first time i just seem to be looking for ways to get through more comfortably the final miles when you enter the unknown but probably the best thing as has been said is to take it easy the first half of the race
yes but not too soon would like to do dublin but also want each marathon to be my best shot and train well it has to fit into your life and other commitments personally do n t want to fall into trap of collecting marathons underperforming and picking up long term overuse injuries which then have a habit of reappearing my immediate goals are improving k and m times this year
jim i am nervous for all of you lot if i do n t see you again jim good luck and enjoy
morning snoopy
hard luck i blew up at the mile mark last year but that was because of a lack of training it took me and a half hours to do the last miles well done anyway though you still beat my pb by over mins bb p s did you drink enough
ali i was the other get you round pacer yesterday i split from john at mile deliberately to carry on at approx min mile pace while he dropped back i finished in from the gun john did n t have a good day and walked in the last few miles
well done everyone i was doing ok till about miles then slowed dramatically finished in according to my watch but flm site showed last night which i reckon was my gun time i did n t enjoy it as much as last year but i think that was a combination of the heat and subconcious pressure on myself to go sub still i finished and i can walk today and even the stairs are n t too much of a challenge see you all next year
batfink that pit bull passed me as well lead and all i was looking for his championchip
for some reason i just thought it would be really funny if paula were to run next year s london marathon in a womble suit or something the look on ndereba s face as she gets beaten by three minutes by a womble would be hilarious so what costumer should paula wear
it felt great to me but that was because my wife and several friends were in the grandstand once i d spotted them and seen my wife holding a camera to her face i suddenly managed to run faster even sprint or that s what it felt like i do n t remember the noise particularly but it was a great moment

i seem to remember overhearing someone on the lucozade stand at the marathon expo saying that the drink handed out during the marathon was slightly different from the stuff you buy in the shops they had made it slightly less sweet to make it easier to take in can anyone confirm this
i do n t think i ll be able to time it that close especially if it s as warm as it was this year just hope to be able to pass big ben and be confidant that the clock will be or less when finishing
i would never had started without the get you round run walk principle it works in this group you are doing for yourselves not against the clock you find you do it for others in the same boat around you go for it

i like doing speed sessions on the tready too as has been said it pushes you had my longest run last night miles absolute sh te the previous long run was and i could easily have done another last night i blew up at and shuffled the last mile in around minutes which for me is very slow bollox hopefully just a temporary set back
hi matt i said i d let you know re long runs our plan is to set off from brookwood bridge on the b stoke canal at tomorrow morning running up to woking and on to byfleet and back round in some way not quite sure of route as yet we re aiming for a couple of hours m distance there ll be me and my friend maxine and her other half john aka coach on his pusher with a mileometer and stopwatch just to make sure we do n t cheat as if do n t feel obliged just happy to support fellow flmers plod on lise

for a half bed now goodnight all
andy have a look at this article on peak performance they have some interesting stuff to say about tapering i reckon you should definitely cut your mileage your body needs a chance to build up glycogen stocks some of their neural training workouts could be worth trying the mantra seems to be cut volume maintain intensity
cheers taffy i ll check with them and see what the official cut off is as it stands i would be happy just to run round but i do n t really want to start walking partly because if the knee is still bad even that could put me out for months i ve only got a few hundred quid in sponsorship probably would have got to about or in the end
is her exercise video any good if so i ll get my wife a copy i ll have to watch it too of course
water stops are wet lucozade stopes are very sticky try not to step on bottles of water as you will tuen an ankle also beware step squashing lucozade pouches and squirting it up other peoples legs is funny until you tread on one that has had top put back on

evening chris i too kept my end of the bargain you re obviously good for me did just under miles not easy to check mileage as i use an alley which does n t show up on road maps and it took me mins secs those secs are really important are n t they i m a bit of a snail as you can see but then again i have n t run since mid sept and had only been training then for one month after a year break it can only improve though eh the hal higdon schedules can be found on the url below i hope to be following the novice one soon but have to try to build up a bit first http www halhigdon com marathon mar index htm calf a bit tender but not too bad we ll see what tomorrow brings rice s it anyway so time will tell at least my achilles held up and is pain free will attempt run again tomorrow if calf ok as the schedule calls for runs on tues wed and thurs so i d better start as i mean to go on great news banana happy shoe hunting and billie sorry to hear about your virus hope you re well and truly on the mend now and back out there running have a good evening all what s left of it it

and a happy new year to everyone as well celebrated the new year by going for my longest training run so far miles in unfortunately the underside of one of my feet is aching i do n t think its plantar faciitis as nothing seems to be painful when i prod it i m suspect its just the pounding its taken this morning
a true northerner well i m taking another rest day i normally run on saturday mornings whilst my daughter is at theatre school but i m still tired so i m leaving it til monday i am also having a major mental readjustment there will be no more going for a time i have done this before over trained crashed and burned i probably wo n t get my sub but i ll actually get to the start line which will be better than last year i ll still do the speed work i enjoy it but i will be very strict with my self on the long run no more turning the sound off the beeping is there for a reason to stop me overdoing it i got very depressed during my training last year then i came down with labyrinthitis and was out of the race i think i was pushing too hard even tho i was run walking sorry if i have rambled on but that s what the forums here for btw the cars brilliant
if you look back a few pages cc emma explains all did in the k could have gone a bit quicker but as first k for a few years did n t want to make an a e of myself doing another k in eastleigh on th march gloves off friday it is hopefully then i ll map out a loop rather than the out and back we are so fond of going to harlow later so off line until tomorrow unless i fork out for internet link in my room wonder what the birthday fairy will bring me while im sleeping this morning

not great news this to put it mildly particularly as i received an email from runners world just a week or so ago confirming the event would go ahead and you were just confirming dates not impressed impressed
ran a miler today with my new rubbery but orangey tasting camelpack the question is should i use it on thr flm it must take up valuable time stopping at waterstations as where the pack gives you continuous movement the litrses is heavy at first but soon gors gors
morning all sounds like everyone is doing brilliantly so i m going to bring the mood down nah not really although my run at the weekend was not the best it s still further than i ve ever gone before is anyone else feeling frustrated even though they are doing things they could n t have comprehended a year ago anyway was aiming for miles in hours but made it back in hrs m so not great it was in a new area near worcester and the malverns and was pretty hilly compared to running in sw london so that s my excuse the only good thing is i have recovered well and have no aches and pains today hr is looking like a fading dream but still as long as i make it around i will be happy silverstone next weekend when of course the goal is hours but will be happy to finish feeling good keep up the good work everyone not long left now
delia hopefully will get it all sorted out and it will prove a blessing in disguise for it to have happened now well done for finishing despite the pain i m sure we ve been told that mental strength is almost more important than physical and you ve proved yours what about menu plans for the day before proven supper dishes to charge us up
t t m hmmm yes i left my last gym because of the minute rule on the machines i had a right go in my pathetic doe eyed girly way about paying a month so i can train in the warm whilst watching eastenders and how am i suposed to train for a marathon in minutes a go etc promptly left and joined their rival ha nice to have long rest i had days off in a row and a half weeks ago and it really did me good started feeling very restless though so went and did that ridiculous rhayader race which nearly killed me and had to have another days off br they say gram of vitamin c every hours for hours will rid you of a cold yes gram may give you a slight orange tinge around the edges though o

i m finding this taper period quite tough to handle mentally and there s still days to go time is dragging also i use running to relax and without that outlet i feel a bit wound up no matter how many taper articles i read i ca n t escape the feeling that my conditioning is starting to ebb away stupid i know but there you go although i am looking forward to the so much it will also be a relief to get my old life back i shall of course carry on running but like tallguy i m really missing my bike i have n t run since doing a rather painful m on tuesday my thighs seem to develop new aches each time i get up in the morning plus i have a sore groin i know there s nothing serious but it all adds to the tension i am planning no more than more runs probably m at marathon pace on sat and then a slow m next tuesday followed by a sports massage massage

it was my first marathon yesterday and think i entered a fair time on my form and started in pen i had been warned about congestion in the first miles but there was none all very civilised and chance to get a good rhythm going the dodging and weaving came in the last miles when i was getting a rhythm again after a bad patch through there were bits where you could n t even try to run in the isle of dogs it was just a stream of walkers perhaps they can put in theoretical slow and fast lanes like at swimming pools and walkers are obliged to move into the other lane with some encouragement from the many course marshalls however i do know that at miles when you re tired etc the last thing you need is some police telling you what to do i plodded in at but with a smile on my face
sounds like my kinda town thanks dustin can you lend me the money i m sure you made enough from kramer v kramer

i m on at the moment although my lr at the weekend was cut to a paltry miles after my husband spent all day out windsurfing was not amused probably not a bad thing though as i had two very tough sessions last week one interval and one tempo which left me feeling quite sore my speed is definitely improving though so the work is worth it next sunday should see me up to miles for the long run and then i go up to milers for the four weeks after that
hi r b running efficiency will improve with fitness it is normal for beginners to be heavy on their feet as as you mention there is n t sufficient pace in the early stages for a smooth heal toe action as fitness comes stride will lengthen a bit and breathing will be more in rythm with cadence so the whole action gets smoother
good time trin well done shame about all the little prob s though hope you heal in time for the robin hood very good idea dips a meeting before chr s got any suggestions where i love that feeling to mava new running shoes mine are falling to bits and have a large red stain from a painting accident i think im gonna have a look for some bargain new ones im a bit of a skin flint though if there over i cant bring myself to buy them spent once and they were the worst shoes i ever had so its back to the bargains bargains
kp i like mile races have you ever done the arbroath women s mile one it s great lovely route and fantastic home baking and lunch at the end too i ll report back on the suit actually i do n t know if my post holiday flab will fit in to it
hi everyone i just wanted to let melf know that i m all over the place with my exercise too at the moment i do feel guilty reading how many of you have set new goals and are working towards those and i want to recapture the determination i had to stick to a training plan before the marathon i think maybe now that the autumn weather is coming i might find it easier to get out there but i know ultimately that the incentive has got to come from me and not the weather
hi all you re dead right about the speed sessions kezzabee i m not keen on them at the best of times and quite often the only time i do them is with the running club or when i run with a couple of mates who are usually better than me been doing quite a bit of off road at the moment preparing for my first proper fell race on sunday although i do n t do any structured speed sessions you can certainly go pretty damm fast downhill after struggling on your hands and knees up the blxxdy hill in the first place went out for a min session at lunchtime a bit of a slog uphill on the road for a good ft of climbing then down through the fields and tracks through the woods which was a bit of fun in my road shoes after the recent rain all good practice for sunday miles and ft of climbing ummmm the guy i was running with is a proper fell runner and did it last year and he was reassuring me just dig in on the way up some of it is hands on knees and try and hang on then see if you make up a bit on the way down just do n t go too fast or you ll be too knackered for the next steep hill gulp looking forward to it more and more although possibly not as intimidating as that bleep test moggie have a good day all cheers beders
so how are people finding out early if they ve got in to flm i do n t get it i thought we did n t find out til december lochaber sounds good as an alternative had a look at paris last night but it seems a bit of an expense really what with flying out there etc what s the best way to get there from down here though fly to inverness and travel from there
and i must remember to switch off the f n e mail notification
waiting like you weds i just spied a thread that i went on two years ago will boing up for you
do you fancy cardiff lt wanders off to check bank account and remember what size fleece i ordered ordered
crumbs i go away for days and realise that i ve opened a can of worms worms
i would recommend the white peak although it is a small race with only runners you are bussed to the start and run back to cromford along the tiisington and high peak trials old railway lines although not hilly it is n t flat either first miles are gradually up high second half downhill with fairly steep downhills if you want to do it you will need to move quickly when the entries open due to the limited numbers that can be accepted there is also a half marathon which runs over the second half of the marathon course
did you bequeath no date cashed or not cashed yet nd nov no of times entered not including this ballot number of times rejected not including this ballot predicted time code e optimistic do you live in london scotland other other do you read the sun other sometimes and other
br cheeky bugger
more welcomes brook and georgias dad gd i am also wating on a club place find out dec brook youll be fine im sure k good to see you posting over here again enjoy the weekend all anyone racing im doing the maylarch eynsham k
evil pixie yeah no worries go ahead and link to me no slacking for me either now
micksta is that as in anything under or as in dead because if one of your aims is a sub minute k a minute k may be a little ambitious mid to low s and maybe sub could be a possibilty if it all comes together though
i put lolal though im following a sub hour training plan lol in training every day and currently the furthest i have run is miles lol im also doing a bit of witght training as im like a stick lol
i have just started this week and am finding it great as it is based on time rather than mileage i just wondered if anyone used to last year and how they rated it
ow that sounds painful stephen hurry back slowly lots of time until flm
trouty yes and his hm time as well he should be down in the s i think his best is xx then he d have a championship place for flm and might be encouraged to have a go always nice to hear from you at tower bridge a friendly local face back any better
get into an argument on the forum spend runs thinking about how to win it
christchurch jon i think that long and slow is the basis for your long runs i dunno a minute or minute and a half slower than marathon pace also i would imagine that the advice from others would also be along the lines of slowly increasing the distance of your long runs miles one week the next the next etc well that s what i d do anyway
toffee park nearer woodford station the roads approaching ashton s are clear it s easier to walk down parking around the track is a nightmare on race day yes people do meet by the water jump you should n t go wrong
ahha just one thing rich you got the wrong shirl the one on the other thread is the mark model think you will find our shirl has deferred due having a life
hi all thought i d just let you know how i got on well for those of you that do n t know they cocked up the course so we ended up doing just under miles i m told my time was which if i adjust for the extra reckon it would have been about not bad as i was aiming for around also had a nasty fall just before ten miles and turned my ankle kept going but the last couple of miles were hard and had to walk at bit but managed to keep running the last mile and even managed a pretty good sprint finish good me for thoroughly enjoyed it doing laps did n t phase me and was estatic to finish feeling reasonably good legs feel fine ankle is sort and have two lovely blisters one on each foot but other than being tired doing good
i suspect i wo n t be there long enough to offer proper support but you all hang out at mile do you teen a is doing the mini mara so i ll see if it s plausible to walk back and say hello at least
jakesy and njord totally agree with jools b on this and your situation puts everything into perspective does n t it it s quite easy to get precious sometimes and feel a bit hard done by if you have to run when you ve had a bad day or whatever steady undulating miler for me today squeezed in between getting home from work and my little girl s bathtime completed in which is around m secs pace and at whr average bye for now as off for my tea nl
i hope it does n t snow either i m working tonight and running tomorrow
is everyone feeling positive and what sort of times are people aiming for i think realistically i am looking at a hr
we only had ten men ten men we only had ten men ten men sorry toffee but class is always permanent i thought we played better without gerrard he did n t do anything in the first mins anyway could have had or in all honesty how ya feeling legless

gweedore im waiting for a new bum bag as got to carry gels phone mp anything else i might need like plasters etc trying to find a belt with kitchen sink attachment not found it yet thou i hear the reason paula has pulled out is because of a fast bunch a forum thread on runners world web site started by a caramel
i hate it when that happens i get so scared
thanks folks can get a train about from h h so would be at london bridge so should be ok
sbf thanks the problem seems to be rooted in the back but it s messing up my gait which has stressed the calves my physio was ill last week but i m seeing him again on thursday hopefully today s massage will also help hope all is well with you
rb that s awesome mate well earned and hope you take time to have a few beers and enjoy your holiday not too bothered about your hr stats we ll let cm sneak off to a private place to drool over those but very keen to hear your mental state throughout the race eg what pace did you set out to run did your plan go out the window when you were running well at what point did you start thinking about your likely finishing time were you consciously or subconsciously racing crab did you think about the feedback you d have to supply to this forum did it help or hinder progress ca n t deny i ve thought about having to cough up my result on here mid race over the past few months what was the priority during the last k just get to the finish or still aim for a particular time was running harder or easier than running for me the quicker the race the easier it has been if you know what i mean did you mentally rehearse your reaction to crossing the line somewhere around the half way mark did you cry fkg hope not what s next on the rb agenda only a couple of minutes from qualifying for those luxury bogs at london next year questions questions look forward to your answers crab keen to know your mental process throughout as well
mel have you used ice or cold baths after your runs not sure about the drink meeting due to work stuff but planning to go to the expo first thing thursday am advance notice in case any of you wanted to avoid another pep talk from me and see me shaking like a jelly when are others planing to pick up their stuff and then shop for england

tempting andy i wonder if i can persuade the other half have two daughters as well who want to be there what hotel is it the main reason we re not staying over is that we re used to driving to london and it s only a minute drive to stratford or one of the dlr stations and about another minutes by tube it s just that all my marathon nerves are being channelled into this one thing right now
tonight gonna have pasta and sause with vegs mixed in oh with extra garlic just to keep colds at bay are you eating more or the same amount of food as usuall i too feel bloated think i should of stopped at bagel bagel

in my view the congestion from the blue start seemed to be caused by the ambulance situated after about m i had assumed this was due to some sort of incident that had occured but watching the video today it was there when the elite woman passed
st paul s youth hostel cheap for a double quiet and close to london bridge station we ve stayed there for the last marathons and it s great
i d start raising money for a charity now the best chance you will have of getting a place is through the golden bond if you can raise in the region of by november you ll have a good chance of getting one the hardest part of the flm is getting a place as for the training everything you have said seems right
i could n t eat after the marathon fenn my appetite has only just returned i did force some recovery drink and an energy bar down but that was it i know that s wrong rio
sub in my case roobarb o do you think carole would be ok to give us an hour of her time to share between us o
evening all was planning on a run or two this weekend or a bit of cycling but instead opted for a night out clubbing on friday we were in the pub by pm and home about ish and then spent the rest of the time paying back my other half for her support since january and spending time with the little one doing some nice family things do feel totally refreshed however and literally chomping at the bit now so going to head out tomorrow after work for a miler sbf that analysis of results was fantastic and ashamed to say that somehow the reds did beat the blues o i uess we all need to keep the momentum going to achieve the goal of sub last night just before bed i was watching a little bit more of the live flm coverage i sky ed last sunday is that your first appearance on tv cas o that bob the builder costume must have taken a lot of efort to make it really was quite impressive afraid i m not going to make abingdon just not practical for me to get there and already have plans for october i m afraid but i will still hang around here for support banter with my own races if thats ok and maybe next year the flm might be in the picture and we will defo have to meet up my race plan for the summer looks like this mile race may k race june k race july half marathon august not sure about sept yet half marathon october with the training required i hope to retain improve overall fitness and improve speed and lose a bit more weight weight
a solid performance good pacing throughout must be harder to run sub in a c vienna compared to a c london does n t research on marathon times find c the ideal temp and c above or below that loss of performance of not sure how they would measure this what s needed a cool autumn marathon
dn for interest i never did get an email back from the cardiff race director on the potential safety issues surrounding the to finishing time just think of the aggro that the poor winner will suffer can i hang on to your skirt tails in abingdon
hi guys not been on here for ages i am struggling to get properly nack into running again lovced the marathon and def want to do another one have entered nottingham half in september so i need to get my backside in gear got ill at begiining of may so was out fr a fortnight but i am enjoying do some excercise other than running back into my circuit training again btw i raided for charity well done on the amount you did bp i entered the edinburgh marathon but i have postponed place to next year as was n t able to get the training runs in a the weekends due to being away all the time glad to see some of you still about
hi all been going out a lot with my club recently and really enjoying it i am definately improving now because of it last friday we did mile relays which was hard but good i got out with them on mondays and wednesdays tomorrow we do the haytor heller course which actually takes place on sunday i am going to be a marshall did a good mile run last night a lot of hills doing a mile race on friday evening which i am looking forward to i am really enjoying my running at the moment i am hoping to build up to dartmoor vale marathon in october and then hopefully london again next year
in reverse if i maintained stride length and ran spams my marathon time would be
mike my target marathon pace his year was in it was and the wednesday runs were correspondingly slower so that s what i was working up to sometimes you get carried away and go a little faster at the start of the build up they were a little slower but as your fitness improves they get to so in my eyes they were marathon paced threshold running would be pace for me and anywya if i could manage a mile race at pace surely pace is ok for those runs
hello runners well missed a load of posts since the flm due to ligamant damage but am back deffered my place so will be in the firstly is this the right place sub hrs or am i too early help help
roobarb also i think everyone recovers differently after lochaber i raced a k and got a pb only days afterwards and after dumfries i raced and got a pb for a k only a week afterwards legs too tired after moray to even think about doing my normal steady pace at the moment never mind race
is it a full length one

susie sorry fingers still a bit numb several hours later lord d thanks for that but i have been doing the step drops times every morning before i do anything else and in the evening when i remember think i ll work up to reps though i ve been told i have tendonosis i e degeneration rather than tendonitis inflammation probably my achilles had mis spent youths do n t worry about remedial it for your daughter it probably means she has excellent social and other non cognitive skills instead lots of evidence from day job that non cognitive skills e g communication team working self efficacy are increasingly important in the labour market
accobatic overhead kick to hammer it home
oops sorry roobs forgot about luton
we seem to be very well catered for with half marathons in the north west as build up helsby village bakery great north western wilmslow liverpool but there is a distinct shortage of further distances the milford miles in staffordshire is the only longer run i can find in travelling distance anyone know one of any other milers anywhere near the north west
guess who is hung over this morning and has n t run bloody gremlins
susan activate your e mail link and i will e mail you i have n t received a reply to the charity who contacted me o and i have support of my employer to guarantee bond o

i did n t buy any official merchandise last time i ran london marathon i sort of regretted it afterwards but looking through the adidas gear it seems a bit pricy has anyone here bought anything from the london marathon range is it good and is it worth paying the extra to have a london marathon logo on it
blimey alex where did all that come from two glasses of shiraz maybe how decadent drinking at lunch time at work reminds me of the old days lt harpy music wafting into the past would love to do ny must see if i still have any knee cartiledge left after flm this year clare is your half on sunday a race race or a race to make a long run more interesting

cg its a shame to hear you say this thread is a little bit scary if you are aspiring to sub then surely this is your thread there are a good few on here that are now running sub style mileage and times probably as a result of training going better than expected and i hope no one else has been put off by this or is worrying too much that their mileage speed is n t up to it i know i ve ran before off about mpw and min mile lsrs so i figure so can anyone else anyway after all that rambling i do n t have anything more to say wrt your question that has n t been said above e g i let my legs chose my sunday lsr pace and it ended up being a lot faster than most training plans would suggest am yet to find out whether or not that was a stupid thing to do was it really worth the risk doubt it
finally gotten rid off my cold after days bloody thing depending on whats on telly later and how awake i feel went from evening shifts to morning shifts with work today so i get less sleep for a night will see how far i run tonight currently tipping down so i think it ll be a treadmill session aim for miles roughly i think gotta remember to ask what each trendline on my funky spreadsheet graph is as i havn t a clue mainly as its a spreadsheet i aquired off another runner at work heck even the boss has been out a few times over the last few weeks at lunchtime
and good luck on sunday m
miles for me today at pace just one more session tomorrow then a mini taper for hastings on sunday looking forward to a couple of rest days after consecutive days of running hastings should be a good test but the bbc weather site is forecasting mph sw winds on sunday which will make the last miles along the seafront a bit of a drag
hi dazpd good to have you back today
erm i got mine last saturday
whoops a pb by mins not
gosh it s good to know there are others a bit like me starting out a bit fast is a worry just because i have not done the distance before
sc ld many thansk for your advice simon
pg here is the link to the part of this site with the rcae time calculator on it basically it is a formula used to convert one races time to anothers which is pretty accurate and is also in the middle of the range you would get if you used some of the other ways of working out race times from other races debra well done on the miles i managed to get miles done in mins running aorund stafford on tuesday night as i was down there for a conference with work stopping up in the bar until am and a slight twinge in my ankle meant i ditched the planned or mile run pre breakfast did mile on the treadmill before work at lunchtime and the ankle was n t to bad just a minor ache at the moment so i think i ve tweaked it probably on the rough ground alongside the dual carriage way in stafford still looking to do miles or so on sunday and as of yet i havn t decided where i ll run too probably stock up on drinks and some food and just run where ever the heck i feel like it i ll probably check i can measure off my garmins sporttracks stuff indivdual sections so i can combine in a load of differing sized laps in the area

morning all just spent the last mins catching up with everyones posts reports congrats and well done to everyone in reality it was that hot that it was an achievement just to finish well that has to be the toughest thing i have ever done i expected the last miles to be tough but that was something else finished in am absolutely chuffed to bit and still have n t stoped smiling think i slept about hours last night i m still buzzing annoyingly i think i made the last few miles so hard myself by going off too fast at miles i was had averaged min miles including around mins by i had dropped the pace slighty to about mins miles and was still well on for sub about ish if i could have kept that pace up but from onwards it seemed like someone had tied bricks round my ankles and i dropped to s and by s managed to run a sub in the last mile but the heat and my quick start had finished me think if it had n t been for the crowd i would have pulled over and collapsed in the gutter but had a lot of friends placed over the last few miles that really kept me going anyway am really pleased and honestly think i have got sub in me just have to learn from my mistakes and hope its cooler next time
yes thanks rio for all your help along the way it has been much appreciated yeah i m the same as you sarah i think it might be the start of a beautiful friendship with running haha

thanks bowi just a bit too far away for me to come and train with you sometimes not an excuse a reason
roobs hope the pain eases soon and or you get a cancellation luckily a lot of the cutty sark artifacts masts etc had been removed for refurbishment so were n t there does n t look to be all that much left that s for sure kp s nose
afternoon roobs i decided yesterday not to do today race as my left leg ached shades well done on your marathon roobs sorry to hear that you are poorly
corredor great pb but just a word of warning advice from one of my club coaches better to improve on your pb by seconds each race than take a huge chunk off and then have to beat that next time on a more positive note unless you ve been running for years i also read that whatever age you start running racing you will improve on your times for c years before you plateau so go for it
i really dont know if they will be worth looking at lol but the new trisuit i have looks ok so i wont be shy for the cameras lol
morning all very hungover or in fact maybe still drunk had good night out in wimbledon where met up with a group from work who were out for a leaving do girl who works in our gym moving to pastures new ended up in nightclub no idea what time we got home have got blisters and kitchen is bomb site after late night peanut butter toast making no running for me today hope things are ok for your guys up norff i am referring to the flooding mean wendy tutu as opposed to susan who although is north of the river and virtually foreign climes i do n t think had weather issues
padams i ve just been sent the results from last night the overall standings after races make interesting reading pos overall score points garden city runners st albans striders barnet district royston runners nhrr bishops stortford you will need to put a good team out for your home event next week if you do n t want barnet to take second place from you they came within points of beating us last night it s also going to be close to see who out of royston and nhrr will be relegated the person who won is down in the results as having a double barrelled surname good luck to those of you having a punt this afternoon
tunbridge wells and tonbridge are miles apart i grew up tw but now live in tonbridge the tour de france is going through both didds lives in neither he works in tw but lives in bex hill which along the coast from hastings didds are you going to watch out goudhurst way
well done katie vrap and gf on your awesome efforts vrap i think you are being too modest a pb after that sort of exertion is phenomenal fast times too for lorenzo and tt mtr you will soon be back on form and will fly in your ds trainers are you planning to alternate them with a different shoe rfj and smiffie thoughts are with and do n t rush back it s not fun i seem to be in an increasing amount of pain and am ccoming to the conclusion that i might have to stop running again i was given the number of a good physio but luck would have it that she is off on holiday for weeks i had quite a long telephone conversation wit her and she thinks i now have a secondary injury possibly pf caused by adjusting to compensate for original injury i will carry on running as long as the pain gets no worse but i m not looking forward to my hm tomorrow finishing that will be harder than any race i have ever done no pbs for me in the near future
hey pug sorry to hear about the injury best advice from me is put all your renowned focus oin to getting it right do whatever the fizz sports therapist says treat the ice stretch mobility exercises or whatever as if they are key parts of your training program then see how it goes maybe you could refocus on luton st weekend in december as tipptop suggests or come down to la rochelle the weekend before with me even if you do n t get a champs start for london you will still have a pen green start and i m sure you would n t let a couple of eastenders actresses get in your way blisters judging by the state of worcester city centre today you re not wrong about what ll be with you sunday and monday never seen the river so high and its going to take a while to receed because no matter where you go there are great expanses of water linked to the smallest of streams as the underlying water table has risen so much managed to find a mile dryish route this evening would have been a slightly more achilles friendly but i got stuck on the tow path for a while with canal on one side and flooded road on the other thankfully it had stopped raining by that point otherwise i might have been a tad worried
caro the smell of the fish n chips is the same as the smell of a bacon buttie irresistable you ll be up for it
welcome back tr good running dana good racing jej will have to give video clip a miss due to dial up connection at home and very effective security at work which leaves me with today s k attempt the fred consensus earlier in the week was that my endurance is good my speed is not oh boy that was the case today i could list some excuses missed a week after dorney only one speed session since and that was on tuesday high mileage for me since etc but the truth is is was just a bad day at the office a very bad day at the office legs felt a bit heavy in my warm up but the first k was done in and i thought things would be alright but from then on in my legs got heavier and heavier it s a fast ish course but not pancake flat i finished in a miserable not a pw principally because my first ever race was a k and i ve tended to do ks at the start of training blocks untapered but not what i wanted will probably write it off as miles hmp as frankly that s all it was ho hum will console myself with a recovery run this evening so that at least the mileage total for the week does n t get wreaked to boot
probably inches wide pinks
well done tracey roobs on your long runs lyndy i get up most mornings at to to go training but for my long runs i do go out a bit later as i like to have my brekkie first morning is the best time of day to run i hate running at night have to go out tonight for a short run before going to the gym as i m a bit behind on this week s mileage it s degrees down here in devon today
evening all loads of posts to catch up with tr one of my favourite subjects that the grandparent rule in football always made me laugh that at the same time as ireland were getting grief over using it england had butcher born in singapore barnes born in jamaica and dorigo born in australia playing for them i always maintained that the rule made sense though as emigration was becoming much more common the rugby one is a joke though live somewhere for years and you can play for them we played italy last year and they substituted a springbok for an argie i thought we were playing an allstar xv sorry to hear the knee is playing up btw fingers crossed it ll clear up in time for nf jej i do n t see any reason why you ca n t be down at that level yourself in time might take a bit more mileage though that s obscene to be able to do that pace off so little mileage fair play to him i ve got a rest day tomorrow tf made it through yet another mad week of training with just a slightly tight left quad to show for it i think that s a decent return total for the week was off days with some good quality in there counting back days i ve done so dull i m afraid your pb is mine could n t do it on a regular basis though only more week of this to go and i have to say i m glad i think it s the mental side i find harder than the physical side still what does n t kill you
roobs listen out between pm and pm
mornin all had a really good club run last night a hilly miles for the last few weeks i ve got back to the club feeling like a complete wreck as i ve linked in with a group of runners who are a bit faster than me and several times around the course i ve been puffing and panting so hard and thinking i ca n t do this i ca n t do this but just about hanging on in there anyway last night i got back feeling ok in fact as high as a kite as i kept up with only feeling the omegod i ca n t do this once and that was up a long hill but did it strange how your body or my body anyway seems to struggle along at the same pace for so long then suddenly feels better one night for no apparent reason just hope it stays probably the tough speed session last week helped will rest achilees now till club run about miles on friday then try and get round mile course on sunday in last sundays time of around ish not bothered if i do n t but nice to have something to aim at good luck to all those of you in races this weekend
crikey so much positive stuff on this thread well done all you racers good to switch on the laptop read through the weekends postings our house resembled emergency ward this weekend with both small children badly one recovering from an op and beginning to milk it somewhat he is male the other female quietly ill on the sofa with some kid like lurgy managed to run never the less ish easy miles on saturday no gadgets at all so no pressure which i prefer for this type of run miles this afternoon kept up a decent pace in view of the fact i was n t going mega long and averaged mm on an undulating route did what i always do and started slow mm s then picked up the pace as the run went on to mm the last miles of this route are pretty much all climb so it s tough to pick but the pace further but useful training i feel good running all
what s more i m sorry if i sound a bit full of myself but whilst checking the edinburgh marathon website i noticed the age qulification based on half marathons is which is only min secs faster than my pb does anyone know of a flat half near london in the next two months
dan a only a couple of miles from me it would be nice to recoup the cost of my new apartment in prize money but i guess i d have to win the flm for that any good team prizes i can think of other local min guys
hrr feel sure you could gfa at edin have you found any suitable looking halves yet what about leicester entries shut on weds this week but they re saying that because there are some postal strikes it s best to enter online there s a course profile does n t look too bad except at mile but i m not sure if it s a hill or just a slight incline i m not v good at judging things altitude wise leicester marathon site site
nickm you can keep the congratulations at the back of the cupboard and get them out another time i have re read the post and i now see what you mean i wondered why you were devestated still a nice run though
about times lol
afternoon all done my last pre leicester run yesterday a slow miles in if i could run at that pace for another miles i would be very pleased approx marathon i wish chest still feels a little tight and i have a niggly cough but should be ok but i know i have not done enough long runs none over miles ozy weather sounds good for sunday sounds like you are getting better hope to see you at the start beders a hatrick your totp mojo is back hope the running is going well

those socks obviously referring to these beauties but would other people wear them if they thought they would help to win races
caro i understand completely it will go honest but you really do need to take it easy til that cold clears a couple of years ago i had a runner with one of my groups who had a cold she ran with me and we did speed reps she ended up with double pneumonia so be warned rest and lots of warm fluids is best when they say feed a cold i think they mean just to ensure you have plenty of vitamins and minerals etc from the days when people had really bad diets so lots of vitamin c and do as much or little as you feel up to
the dangerous book for boys is a superb read i got one for my birthday loads of handy things in there including how to win at conkers and how to build the ultimate treehouse
coxy i can see there buildings from my window what have i done ive just entered the benfleet on th january multi terrain and iam a bit of a woosie in muddy conditions oh well chin dtb you will be on the mend soon iam sure
looking at the route i like the idea of the later stages on day in epping forest and the north downs way sections on day not too long and quite hilly
richard are the programs available online somewhere
hi all went out for a short run on the track lots of wind and rain managed to run at a comfortable pace this gives me confidence to try and achieve min or there abouts in the mile race on sunday it will be a pb what ever happens as i have never done a mile race before miles m m m s ave hr max hr max speed mph mph
dl weeks is n t so bad and its good timing for family brownie points get the swimming done instead
just get out and run you know the basics build in rest days and work on building distance try a run tomorrow to see where you are in terms of fitness
have fun everyone
pug i raced times and did intervals between crimbo and new years day jej either you complimented me for my efforts or you are calling me slow for taking so long to do the miles
oh yes of course dave they come in handy for wading through fields of horse poo and mud right off for my miles before my group tonight got a beginner starting so be back to run walk for a bit happy training
wardi i failed to run sub at milton keyneshm and shortly after ran a pb at abingdon i would n t get too down about a performance in just one race i remember talking to you post flm my advice for what it s worth is just keep working i have run pb s in having started road racing aged sadly none over the marathon distance but i m convinced by the way i feel that i m still getting faster and stronger the more i train i am lucky enough to sometimes chat to rivals one of them told me they started aged and reckoned they peaked at the guy is now and considerably faster than me keep on trucking it s a long road but hopefully we will both get our over sub best wishes dull
the ocd got the better of the cnba so i went out for the lunchtime reps session x min hard sec off min hard sec off the last long rep was stopped halfway as the lead guy went over on his ankle he was ok so after a couple of minutes we finished with a fast min a tough session esp when running into the wind like joolska i do n t mind occasionally running for charity but i do n t like assumption that the two go hand in hand by default when mrsc and i got married in we took the view that as we had being living together for the previous yrs already had kids mortgage etc we did n t want wedding presents so we asked people to sponsor us our friends family were very generous at the time so i would n t want to ask people again
good running martin does n t matter if runs are a little shorter than the schedule would n t worry too much back from my intervals really enjoyed them yet again yay did x m fast with min recoveries still do n t do them spectacularly fast think the fastest averaged mm pace and the slowest was around v steep hill though quick question re hill running do you guys run hills on your toes feels like such an amateur question to ask but have only just noticed what a different it makes it s incredible however right big toenail is black again and very weak so not sure they like it so much much
afternoon all another outbreak of sensibility this end had a carp night kept waking up cos of the lurgy so decided to forego the planned lsr and slept instead no running til monday at the earliest this end now still at least i got in the bag just a shame i missed out on the other planned sorry to see there s other lurgified folks but better now than months time do n t know what s going on with everybody being sensible must be something in the water at this rate i reckon next week will be primarily slow mileage again which will leave me with a week build up and a week taper should be more than enough to get my tergat i think gatorade league km i wear adidas supernova cushion too have you found a replacement for them cos the new models are wider across the midfoot or does that not affect you good luck to all weekend racers
hey gd just popped over from the other thread to say hi i too am trying to lose weight and do n t eat meat and a finding it tricky does anyone have the link for nam bear s thread i ca n t seem to find it hope you manage to fix your problem
count your blessings eh
afternoon folks nice to see your back trin rich made me laugh the other week describing the ice baths you get him to take after any run over miles he says he keeps stopping at miles he s nearly convinced me its a good idea well done on surviving the river bank rollick rich i ve never fancied it as every year the conditions seem to be appalling nice to see the monument route on your dream team page welcome to hogweed country hope you all enjoy your long runs this weekend at least it should be dry here in brizzle
brave man blisters be a warrior it is your destiny good luck luck
blisters top running great effort the forum shows theres been some good training this weekend i managed my first ever mile run on sunday tried to make it slow as recommended but ran it in hr mins maybe a bit too fast for st time on longest ever run at the end felt tired and realising just how far miles really is today i went for what was supposed to be a short slow run with a friend who is also running flm unfortunately friend is very fast experienced runner around hr for marathon and i wanted to try and keep up we did mile cross country in hr min felt like nearly tempo pace due to wet boggy ground i am going to take it slower for rest of week but feel good no aches or pains pains
i have n t touched alcohol since the day i bought my first car years ago so it s not an issue for me kenyan hills tonight x minutes with minutes recovery between the sessions averaged around pace with the heartbeat average and max slowly climbing until the last few laps had a peak of and an average of safe to say i could n t have gone much harder quite a satisfying session though if only my shins were n t so sore afterwards time for a soak in the bath i think
for me sore knees means i need a new pair of trainers how old are yours you might also want to look at shock absorbing inserts for you trainers sorbothane inserts are what i use try running offroad also dave
lardarse haile only got to half way last year be careful copying him gels and jelly babies seem identical in content and i ve used both for the race last year i carried a couple of gels but did n t actually use them the lucozade sport seemed to work fine for me for training runs i do n t bother with gels or any food the idea on long slow runs is to train your body to burn fat and slowly deplete the available muscle glycogen so i feel it counterproductive to fuel during the run as for one jelly baby per mile whatever works for you really be aware that you will burn calories each mile so any food intake for fuel replacement will make a relatively small impact unless you can consume calories per mile in which case you will struggle to force it down timing wise the earlier you consume the better nothing you eat after or so miles will make any difference as it takes a fair amount of time to metabolise the gel food same principle for water drink early before you are really thirsty rather than playing catch up with fluids later in the race
hope you manage an extra few hours kip tracey
yes you do but you re allowed coz it is your thread good run rich these long one are getting hard now are n t they they
thing is i did n t think you could post unless you were a subscriber
thanks jools will appreciate the support
do n t worry doodle had a massage last night and seeing the physio tomorrow morning and have been icing all yesterday unfortunately my knees have a tendency to do this marathon training or not but it s much better today thanks how are you fairing lucy i totally agree about the speedwork it s all about just getting round in one piece this time and working on speed after that
brian run slower in the so not to kill yourself rb patience pp good to see more common sense being used
tootie really sorry to hear about your bath experience i have to say that most of my own worst running experiences have come in really big races i much prefer less congestion and fewer fat joggers in headphones too many clothes carrying gels and water bottles who stupidly line up in the sub pens getting in my way less hanging about at the start when the fields are smaller too so well done on merely suriving that horrible experience chin up lass lass
padams must have been a small chap you better had over your prize before he gets angry
hi everyone ive had a couple of gym sessions this week just taking it easy well done on the mile run during the week caz i wish i could find the time and the energy i m not running for any charity this time i do the great north run every year and raise for diabetes uk i know when i m on the start line i will feel guilty for not raising anything and you see the tshirts and charity tops but i just didnt want the hassle this time round good luck with everyones fund raising efforts i know how hard it can be what day is everyone going to the expo im going on saturday morning as im travelling down on the am train from durham

padams not in great shape but still waiting in the wings would be a real bummer if this late someone gets a knock flu and there was no one trained up ready to step in still such is the quality of the squad though i think you d crack the record with just dull
i had a quick squint at the website and ca n t see any way of tracking participants not that we know race numbers of phil br hilly etc right must stop wasting time on t internet or i ll never get out of the office in daylight

marigold nice one this is who you re looking for did or miles after work and some strides knee still aches but wtf after m i bet everything else will hurt too
timely xpost thanks crab crab
i would recommend waiting at least two weeks before signing up to any more marathons i signed up to two just after flm spent the year training for marathons having said that i have also signed up for flm but mostly to keep my rejection count up if i get a place next year it will defo be done as a fun run with some outfit or other no ladies cloths or underwear though as i saw quite enough of that on sunday during the race
i cant make friday but how about we all meet sometime and run along the embankment to westminster and then along birdcage walk and round to the finish line if we do it in the summer we could have a picnic and bubbly in the park afterwards
i ve just heard about the easy easy wish i could of seen that if any one has that on video please put on a link mick n phil please leave a post so we no how you to are feeling with the day
hi folks bit nervous about posting in here amongst proper serious runners but i am looking for a little advice and perspective if possible long story short is that i began running in late summer and completed the dublin marathon in oct in since then i have finished a further in progressivly faster times until i hit in rotterdam at the weekend i ve also done a couple of k races as sharpeners the most recent of which was m short and i finsihed in a race time of x so i figure it would have been min mark for the full race distance training stayed pretty static at ish miles until the last marathon where i upped it to around miles per week on average and brought in speed work for the first time having finsihed rotterdam feeling fairly strong last three miles were all under min mile pace i have this mad idea that i couldgo a bit faster current plan is to focus on a k race at the end of june i ve never focussed on a k before and it ll be interesting to see how fast i can go and then a marathon in oct but i have this mad idea that with proper speedwork and more miles i might get close to teh magic am i being delusional delusional
bootsie abingdon is a nice marathon it was my first marathon
i ve never been to a medium it was as much as i could do to drop below extra large
ff do n t they ask for your competition licence number to get the affiliated discount all races from april this year are meant to do that

good luck with your training plans susie and tootie can t advise dids on a new garmin i have been leading an economist s awayday in birmingham for days which was very successful i think and before that i was at my sister s th wedding celebrations in colchester but i need a new knee i went for a run on sunday morning despite the ache in my knee got to miles and i had to stop and walk the remaining miles home as i could n t bend my right knee any more it was agony since then i have been icing it and taking nurofen and walking backwards downstairs the pain has reduced but i jogged miles while coaching last night and it s not good enough to run on yet very fed up off to bristol shortly shortly
another quality mileage week from tt just looking at your target hm time compared to last year shows it s obviously working well for you miles for me tonight pity only of them was running but good to do a bit anyway my min mile this evening was slightly more comfortable than fridays so at least i know i m not making it worse with my mile jogs average speed for the bike ride was mph with a cadence average of so a nice improvement on the same route as friday starting to really enjoy this cycling malarky
matilda frances frith arrived at today after hrs in labour with pushing at the end can only be described as brutal i feel like i have done rounds in the ring with mike tyson however of course she is gorgeous but if there are ever to be anymore it s epidural all the way kg lb oz so dave wins the wt my dad won the date was n t a fix i promise have n t slept really since mon morning so off to bed for me until someone needs boobage thanks for thinking of me will post pics soon

morning all great running cj i took part in a friendly experiment this morning and ran miles at min mile pace with an avghr of i can honestly say i found it hard to run so slowly
i ve stopped giggling lyndy so you just ignore this orrible lot
i love porridge i would eat it every day with a bit of honey and a spoon although to be truthful i have n t actually eaten it since before london bit dead on here today so may go a wonder and find some other poor sods to bother the edinburgh lot are always very chatty
cheers for the sock links comments my issues with them though is simply that they tend to stick in all the wrong places on me same places with every pair i ve tried as a result i gave up wearing socks a few months back and feel better for it the only slight niggle is the insoles on the streaks may try glue them back and see if that does it gobi why braver for not wearing socks full stop or for not wearing them until it gets really cold not a bad tip there jools i like that m with a bit of pmp work thrown in at lunchtime felt a bit rubbish at first though hr was where it should be presumably from having a carp night s sleep jr is a little poorly at the moment so woke up a few times but loosened woke up eventually done my usual by looking for consistent splits on feel with an occasional glance at the watch to confirm and felt much better as it progressed i even felt good enough to open up a bit for part of the last mile and have a bit of fun warming up nicely here too i was covered in goose bumps at the start but it was quite nice by the time i finished
hmm quiet today i m feeling better and am just back from a bike ride i still freak out riding a bike on the road with cars but i ll have to get used to it love those trails though thanks for all the support guys

huge thanks susan and chi for supporting my bid for fame
how to choose going on the choices for the gnr super six it seems to me that the criteria is to have a range of ages ability experience which is fair enough that way there should be something in the resulting traing programmes and blogs to help everyone on their way to be honest if i were a judge i d sort the entries into non starters basically those who have n t followed the rules the main one being words and then have an idea of the categories i was after and sort the rest into those see if there were any stand out winners or losers if not chuck them in a hat and draw out a winner for each catagory while there are a few entries that pull on the heart strings most are hard to distinguish as being any more worthwhile than another mine being one of those anyway as i see it my method of choosing is probably the only way i ll win
hi i think r w s could help me when i was forty i did i would like to try do that again or better now that i am fifty my running club had two place i tried to get one but was unlucky again so it could be a good birthday present ten day s late please thanks danny mclaughlin
hi my name is susan nearly the dreaded my brief running history is as follows dont blink or you ll miss it avoided running at school and afterwards then i joined the fire service and learned to run with ladders and heavy pumps etc scroll forward years and i discovered that i enjoyed running without ladders and fire kit and did a k in about minutes scroll forward again to getting a promotion which entailed a minute commute each day which effectively killed my free running time now working back near home and getting back into fitness at the gym doing fitness classes a few times a week and running occasionally with my border collie pup current goals hubby has done half marathons and i need to do a full one to beat him not that he eveer mentions it ha plus i want to run off the stone i have put on with commuting deskjob and drinking wine i know i enjoy running once i get back into it marathon goal to get round in daylight hours and raise lots of money for the firefighters charity the stroke association and my local hospital who looked after my dad so well reasons for deserving this well i am sure there will be more deserving than me and good luck to all of you but on a serious note my family has had a hard three years after my dad had a stroke and he has recently died i have been involved with mum and dad making sure everything is ok with them and the pressure for those years has been tremendous then my dad s death and everything that goes with it add onto that a very busy role at work running a home family horse and small business too my blogs wo n t be boring but brace yourselves for tales of blood blisters and snot

thats good that mm feels easy i remember doing a mile mp run weeks before my last marathon i wouldnt have described it as easy not hard either though somewhere between if that makes sense on race day i ended up averaging that pace so the fact that it felt easy is a very good sign just run miles to and from the gym to do mins at the gym legs could tell they had done something hard yesterday and hr was way higher than normal am not going to running club tommorrow night instead i will do some very slow miles on my own
nice one wardi it was probably ode ode

fantastic captain well done and to you too agt cracking attitude i looked for cg at the start but the fgfa was a bit of a free for all i lined up with two clubmates and they were supposedly in different pens having different numbers to me the toilet at teh fgfa made me laugh the geordie comic stating that it was def not a wet race as i was lined up with or blokes all p pound ssing up against a tarpaulin sheet the organisation was spot on but one query for those on red did anyone else think the first two mile markers were a little out i was desp to keep hand brake on and sailed past mile in and then at mile two i got taken by the rw mm train steaming past on the pavement and that was at ok mm for them to get settled but they really stormed past in a hurry once red and blue mixed i pulled the reins and put less coal in the bucket not been able to log on to vflm yet are there details for the gfa process
not having any luck at all can t even get onto the contact us page lots of sweary words they need to come up with a better way of entering the ballot
if you have any adidas outlet stores by you they sometimes sell race kit off cheap aaages after the event
sub or bust you set up this inspirational forum and have to say as a fellow spurs fan well i m guessing from the cockrell if you were up to miles in may last year its there and depending on whereabouts in scotland you might have quite a bit of running potential in them parts thanks for getting this going as it helped spur me on really no pun intended there with the others who joined in a sub is well within reach as i know someone who only got back into running this year to finish in and she had done nothing for years so its possible good luck luck

tr got the sportive in the diary should be good
well i nearly had weeks off went for a miler and how slow was i i think i could walk faster than this pre marathon how can you lose so much fitness in weeks it is scary i am just gonna take it easy with mile runs for the next few weeks with no consecutive days and no speedwork until seen physio got my letter today only been days who said nhs is slow however on a positive note i have entered the silverstone half again next year with my dad he does not run but has set it as his goal he has a few stone to lose and had a heart bypass several years ago and a heart attack but was so inspired by me completing the marathon that he is giving this a go gonna start slowly with lots of walking and take it from there that has got to be right up there with completing the marathon itself to be able to influence somebody like that kind of leaves me a bit choked i feel super super super proud my sis is also gonna start in the next few days so a right family affair happening here know what you mean about logging the food i am trying not to add everything to favourites as that would speed the logging process and encourage me to eat more not a good idea ht do it do it you know you want to we will all support you along the way
right tmap in that case i m never doing berlin i was in hospital for over a week when i was and it was n t an accident
glad that you re back out there and enjoying it gatton
yes old the faster gfa runners have their own area at the front of the red start the rest go from the green start behind the celebrities you re probably going to ask what constitutes a faster gfa time but i do n t know all based on what happened this year there s no accounting for what may happen in the glorious new virgin world
