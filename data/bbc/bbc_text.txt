where were the suicide pilots from where is bin laden from where is the wahhabist philosophy that inspires these people from where are almost all terrorists from the middle east right and where are the coalition troops the middle east right it s time you started thinking of the entire area rather then specific countries the whole place is riddled with nutcases and with just a little more time and prodding you might have eventually arrived at that conclusion on your own
smoker mainland britain consists of england scotland and wales so it is possible why did n t bush and blair sort out how to achieve democracy before invading iraq it could have saved up to lives
hmmm the guy who took it with his government is now the number one terrorist everyone who take these question with the government hands up on american terror list just as any anyone who shakes hands with rumsfeld in middle east becomes a terrorist a few years later gt gt gt gt so are you saying they re regular muslims
yes let s not forget that there are people on the flight deck on this aircraft and the co pilot would also have had his hands full doing his part i get so annoyed when they only ever refer to the hero pilot it is remarkable that there were no casualties and for this we must all be very thankful on a different tack i can just see the lawyers rubbing their hands in glee for the broken finger nail damages etc watch this space for the law suits guaranteed suits guaranteed
he s a religious fanatic which is worse than your average cretin
who s got it then
where did they live where i live there s quite a few people with st georges flag outside the house house
i ll cancel those binoculars i ordered
well yes i do there were many who lived under nazi occupation who strongly supported joe stalin in occupied holland for example it was the communists who organised the hiding and escape of jews in britain in uncle joe would have come third in a popularity contest behind churchill and king george vi and ahead of roosevelt who said nice things but had n t actually provided any troops yet and of course there were millions of decent men and women in the s and s who looked to communism as a better way than the economic system they had to live under so a blanket kneejerk condemnation is simplistic nice try grant but that was not the question asked so you will readily denounce pinochet somoza the shah of iran to name but three and those who supported them as to democracy we can discuss what democracy means after you ve cleared up this little matter
cheddi on what grounds should israel give up its jewish status just to make the arabs happy do you think that if jews said we want to all live in saudi arabia so we want it to change its stauts as a muslim state and become a democratic one for all after all the jews are living in the same part of the world are they not just because your naighbor wants something and is using violence to try and get it you should change your national identity to keep the enemy happy either the enemy is willing to accept reality using diplomacy or they want to use violence so you use violence back and crush them but you dont just say i give up i am going to give up my identity so you can be happy the arabs can give up terror accept the only option avalible is states based not exactly on the ceacefire borders but if they use terror they dont get states and they dont get israel to agree to give up its status as a jewish state no organistion like the un or country us included can make israel change its stauts its never going to be anything but an arab fantasy fantasy

the nazi s did n t even want jews as a workforce during a war they wanted all jews dead quite frankly i doubt you ve ever been to the south because your comments show a lot of ignorance about the region now if a white person brutally murders a person of any race in any state in the south they are prosecuted and usually sentenced to death not usually by any means the number of blacks as opposed to whites sentenced to death even for the same crimes is disproportionate whenever a shortcomingof the us is ever pointed out its appeasers and defenders always try and justify it by some idiotic reference to conditions in kazakhstan or outer mongolia as if that is the moral compass and of course kazahkstan etc do not claim to be paradises of tolerance and human rights in this case the fact the pupil felt he had to ask permission to sit under a certain tree in his own country is appalling enough one wonders what similar incidents go unreported one remembers that wounded black female soldier who openly wondered why her own combat story was soemhow less interesting then the very white jessica lynch it is also legitimate to ask if other symbols had been hung on the tree would they have equally been dismissed as a prank prank

the irony of it all is that whilst the west looks to impose democracy on the east by bringing it out from its draconian measues and social systems it itself is pushing through legislation which is considered draconian and is vehemently opposed by all human rights and freedom of speech groups somebody obviously seems to have come to a conclusion that there is only one system of social administration that is acceptable and that the both east and west arent there yet surely the land and its people should have the right to decide what laws they wish to govern their land by and if so let the muslims lands follow shariah law and let america follow democracy why the constant to force others to do how you want them to behave and can the anti islamists please not jump on this and say that it is the muslims who impose themselves on the west as we that response is getting ridiculous

its only logical that diplomats should have imunity they are after all not there as individuals they are their to represent their countries government how can you expect politcal business to take place if the diplomats are scared to go to meetings abroad your going to limit diplomacy to the telephone diplomats are already exempt from customs checks their lugage cannot be searched they can carry weapons or have armed gaurds so they are not like ordinary individuals what would happen if somebody in maybe france or russia managed to get a judge to issue a warrnet for the arrest of bush and blair because they belived that what happened in iraq was war crimes what would happen of the most powerfull men in the world couldnt go to france or russia to discuss diplomatic business private individuals fine issue warents and they can be arrested no get out clause but if your talking about diplomats your getting inton dangerous territory territory

grant the point is i have n t had an answer you declined to talk about the spanish civil war when i had n t even asked you to i asked you to comment on the us entering into a military alliance with fascist spain in the early s in fact in summarising our debate over mc carthyism it is clear that your argument is hypocritical and full of holes you ve made a statement along the lines of we should be vigilant against fascism and communism well the us govt certainly was n t i ve already pointed that the the us admin worked with fascists in greece italy and spain as well as a host of murderous dictatorial regimes across the globe yet you build an argument around the need to protect freedom this is utterly hypocritical the us during the mc carthy period was hounding people they believed were communists or used to be or knew somebody who was or thought they knew somebody or was etc etc all in the name of freedom but who were the kind of people being hounded i would never join the cp but am more than aware of how many of their members have rallied to progressiove causes in britain who was it who stood in the front line when the british union of fascists tried to drive out the jews the cp and who was it who fought against and suffered under the nazis in germany and what would nelson mandela say imprisoned for years who was it in the front line against the vile apartheid regime the cp whilst the us on the other hand were happy to work with the regime in the military conflict in angola the truth is mc carthyism has nothing to do with preventing mass murder by stalinism and everything to do with denying freedom in the us itself you say you are for trade union freedom but mc carthyism amounted to hounding union officials out of jobs and sacking people for not signing loyalty oaths the kind of unionism you favour is compliant unionism the tame variety that does fight for members interests this is what mc carthyism was all about talking about freedom whilst dealing with fascists hounding people who the most likely to rally for freedom of black people in the usa and south africa a final point about islam again you spout hypocrisy on this issue for years the us has used saudi arabia as a client state in its dealings in the oil rich middle east yet this alliance has spawned the likes of bin laden the irony is presumably lost on you so let s have no more of this hypocritical posturing on the need to fight for freedom freedom

your argument lt lt once again do you have the same theories about every piece of land who is the true owner of england saxon dane celt this is very bad news for most of the people who think they are citizens of a country like the usa gt gt what are my theories about every piece of land i am talking about people people have connections with with geographic regions lt lt i thought you were saying that as long as you could keep palestinians off their land until the first generation were all dead then that would make their dispossession acceptable i do not think that is the right way to treat anyone armenian jew or palestinian gt gt it would help if you read what i actually wrote and then consequent upon digestion thereof you responded with your opinion i pointed out that most palestinians who were alive in are now no longer alive even if they were born in they would now be the vast majority of the palestinians were born post this is a simple fact so now on what basis do you advance the notion that they have the right to go and live in the state of israel pay close attention to the last three words state of israel nine syllables concatenate aspirate appreciate lt lt first of all nowhere did i say that if you can displace a population for long enough then it does not matter and i challenge you to either point where i said as much or withdrw that remark gt gt you then go on to quote two paragraphs from my previous post that do not in any way substantiate or even speak to the idea that it does not matter in fact if you go back and read my posts you will find that i am sympathetic to palestinian aspirations towards statehood lt lt i do not know why i am finding it so hard to explain that i find all this talk of who is or is n t a people both absurd and sinister we should treat people as individuals when considering the right way to treat a fellow british person is i do not first need to find out if they are a jew similarly states have a duty to displaced persons their people is irrelevant gt gt and i on the other hand am quite astonished at your difficulty it seem to me that you are taking great pains to deny the existence of the fundamental anthropological imperative to form cultures yes of course we should and do treat people as individuals but your next statement is at once problematic yet informative and belies a smidgeon of arrogance on your part you have a world view it is your world view if you do not consider the individual as he has self defined himself you have abrogated to ourself the right to impose a world view upon him because without consideration to the way he has self defined himself all mutual interaction has to be based upon your world view i love pork crackling they are cheap and the after taste hangs around

british bomber pilots in front of germans i would hope that you transact with other people with a bit more sensitivity lt lt so your difference with the bnp is that they are interested in race and you are interested in something called self identity gt gt i am not interested in self identity it exists it is lt lt actually the mainstream bnp tend to use your approach these days they deny their dislike of immigrants is about racism it is all about shared values and britishness gt gt the bnp can use whatever disengenous approach they like to camouflage the fact that their ideals are racist however shared values and britishness are quite correctly mainstream concepts and are incorporated into both labour and conservative party policies lt lt no it s not up to them it is up to all of us to fight against that sort of behaviour gt again you arrogant slip is showing on what basis do you abrogate to yourself the right to decide how others view themselves their history their heritage their norms and who others wish or do not wish to associate with i am quite franjly astonished at your arrogance would you then take issue with nelson mandela then when he offered afrikaaners the option of constitutionally negotiating for an afrikaaner homeland lt lt you are free to associate for your mutual benefit but only up to the point where it infringes on the rights of other groups to equal treatment do i really need to tell you this gt gt no what you do need to do is explain yourself freedom of association is just that freedom of association hotmousemat i really think that you need to step back and think about all of the contradictions in your arguments just by way of example you tell me that you have great difficulty in underestanding the notion of a people then in one of your other posts unrelated to our discussion you write lt lt but when we see a people behaving in a way that seems unreasonable it is as well to try to understand how it may seem from their point of view gt gt my caps so maybe your difficulty is a contrived difficulty no
quite right

mondial the tragedy of iraq is that the majority of the killing of people is done by fellow iraqis not the us uk occupiers much was made of the shock and awe bombing campaign however this was not wwii style carpet bombing of cities with hundreds of planes precision bombing of military targets means vast blocks of cities are n t taken out just to hit one target fellow iraqis are bombing markets football celebrations mosques etc all deliberate civilian killing please do n t believe i supported this invasion for one minute it was a disaster and unnecessary from the beginning with that said iraq pales in comparison to the genocide in sudan is it that the us uk are involved that makes it worse to some i do n t see how one or two bombs used selectively is any worse than the million killed each by stalin or mao then there s the killing fields of cambodia rwanda in the s etc

sorry ruth i was n t responding to you but to post from insultan groover is just my favoured term of casual address i think the fact that i was responding to another post led to confusion as to meaning i think there is a place for opinion and comment within the wider news however i think it must be clearly authored and distinct from straight news as it were i think it s only a problem when news organisations editorialise instead of reporting as to theorising maybe i do have a theory yippee however the basis of my theory is that the actions of any power when in conflict with a party demonstrably weaker in conventional terms are subject to greater scrutiny and criticism than those of their opponent for all the reasons gone over before as to terrorism itself being inevitable in a given situation yes and no i can empaphise with what might lead someone to the conclusion that such might be their preferred option but remarkable as it seems this is not an inevitability it is a choice see tibet lizards from space are these the same lizards who are behind the international money markets and the re branding of consumer brands you re theory is gaining weight weight

hey zabacs gt gt yeah thats what i thought regarding muslim world i mean western europe sorry for mis spelling lt lt no need to apologise zabacs it is an understandable mistake to make and the worst you can be accused of is forward thinking gt gt yet property could do fine around here no muslims around and if eu breaks down before blood in streets in muslim controlled euarabia countries lt lt what do you think will happen to eastern europe when western europe collapses into another of the long nights of bloodletting that it so loves i had assumed that since so many east european ecnomies are tied into west european ones and share the downward demographic spiral although not the upward muslim one they would get dragged down part of the way too a bit like britain however resourceful and skilled populations there may pull away once freed from the dead and patronising hand of euroleftism which way do you think it will go yours gavin gavin

constantly i have never claimed that i am anything but some guy posting on the internet yes on second thought when you said please stop it all this home spun moralising is making me want to cry i should have seen that as the friendly post it was and i talked about the shallowness of making mass assumptions on a person based on either where they come from or what t shirt they are wearing thats fine if you see some guy wearing a t shirt that says something you agree with and automatically feel you have more in common with them that is great for you i personally would talk to a person get to know them and then decide if i have anything in common with them the leader of their homeland or choice of t shirt are not real pursuasive influences on me so when you see a pimply faced kid wearing a i love vegetarians or a che guvera shirt on one side of the street and a person wearing just a regular button down shirt you automatically figure you have more in common with the kid okedoke okedoke

their side of the story is poorer than the one i presented nonexistent wmds and a clear and present danger where there could n t possibly have been one that s your opinion and your entitled to it however i will not take saddam s side of the story at face value he was not remotely trustworthy and imo cooked up the whole story of kuwait stealing iraqi oil as a smokescreen to cover up the real reason for the invasion he had bankrupted the iraqi economy and simply set out to plunder his wealthier neighbour look at the widespread and systematic looting carried out by his forces in kuwait i will condemn atrocities committed in kuwait that you ve made reference to but believe that iraq did and does have an historic claim on kuwait as iraqi territory however i concede that the un would have been a better arbiter in such a claim as opposed to the unilateral invasion that iraq undertook i agree

pit man it seems that jj has started two threads on this subject in an attempt to portray europe as somehow being the only culprit in this business which is far from the case as i ve already proved on the other thread you proved nothing and europes dispicable behavior speaks for itself especially in light of your agreement and posturing to the contray your hip deep in current toxic waste disposal business and it s killing people the point is that europe has passed laws and entered into an international un backed treaty to stamp this trade out that agreement was years ago how long do you need obviously it will require some effort and take time but the us has refused to ratify the same treaty in fact it s the only major nation which refuses to do so i ll look into why the us austarlia and number of countruies did n t sign but once again euro s did sign but continue to dump whats up with that in fact it s the only major nation which refuses to do so which weakens the agreement and makes things harder for everyone which weakens the agreement and makes things harder for everyone what you need the us to behave correctly typical lol yes it s bad and unacceptable but jj ought to do some research before he launches into another of his inadequate euro bashing tantrums it s so easy as you are euro hypocrites hypocrites

the article points out while the president s sentiments about invading iraq were known at the time so there is nothing new in this the article is talking about a second un resolution and it is well known that the us were not in favour of one believing that the existing un resolutions were sufficient it was blair the usual incompetent blair who wanted a second resolution to appease his opwn party and bush agreed to help him in a joint press conference before the wart bush clearly pointed out the purpose was regime change this is always been clear and not covered up by the us the french were busy making money out of saddam and we now know all about the illegal oil for fraud scam

ah blue sea nice to see the postings divorced from their context no doubt you think you are very clever but actually its a bit of a cheat however this reminded me of something the jews have been a corpus separatum for more than three thousand years and counting how might that be jews are not the only group of people who have lived apart from their neighbours or who have been driven from their original lands you have the example of the chinese communities dotted around southern asia you have the roma historically you have the huguenots the cathars the alans the sassanid and additionally you have the expat communities of bankers and traders lombards venetians netherlanders even scots they ve left their traces in family names in odd places street names churches and houses historically all have been shunned and persecuted from time to time historically too all have eventually assimilated into their host community through inter marriage and such except the roma whose wandering life style rather precludes assimilation jews assimilate too but there must be some special reason for the supposed year corpus separatum
no point in having a new toy if you ca n t play with it right as to illegal war i did n t follow the machinations of the build up to the iraq invasion too closely but if you have a quick google you ll probably find that there was some argument over the need for a nd un resolution which was sought but not secured prior to invasion as i recall best regards rad

madamecargoes i never aked for jews to be expelled from jerusalem but i think that a land a town a city or a country should not belong to one group in fonction of their belief also madame you should take into consideration that jerusalem is an important city for christians and mulsims as well and that it seems very unfair that it should belong to one group only specaily if we consider that lage numbers of christians and muslims were jews before jesus and mohamet came and created new religions religions

how nieve that people here think that handing over the soldier will mean an end to the problem israel has been holding gaza and the west bank hostage for years will handing over the soldier mean that israel will withdraw to the pre border will it mean the right of return for the palestinian refugees will it mean the release of the palestinian kids and women from israeli prisions will it mean that israel will stop the incessant shelling on the occupied territories and stops arrresting palestinian freely i think not israel must stop its arrogant wrong policy and seek for peace through diplomacy and not bullets if it wants to live in peace among its arab neighbours say to israel enough of bloodshed and be civilized civilized

message posted by bordeaux nothing in my post disputed the inclusivity of hmd other than the armenian genocide i pointed out that though the armenian church disputes hmd they do not boycott i also stated that i felt that the view of politicos handwringing for a few moments doesnt fit well with the dignity of the memory so what point have i missed in that re rwanda i was making the point about hmd being inclusive one of ghe reasons often cited for the day being unjustified is that it is n t i have only accused the mcb of boycotting hmd because they refuse to accept the invitation for those who refuse to accept the part played by the holocaust in the creation of israel please make a note so i guess it was this that made me think you were emphasising a lack of inclusivity i may have misinterpreted that both genocides along with other massacres should be studied and quitely commemorated with permanent memorials hmd somehow demeans the whole however i do not share your opinion of hmd being in any way demeaning the service is quiet and dignified and it is quite correct that politicos are reminded of what the consequences of their actions are referring to such commemorations as handwringing does rather suggest to me that it is those who do not like such days who have less respect for some tragedies than others others

the cia has so far refused to hand over control of iraq s intelligence service to the newly elected iraqi government in a turf war that exposes serious doubts the bush administration has over the ability of iraqi leaders to fight the insurgency and worries about the new government s close ties to iran the director of iraq s secret police a general who took part in a failed coup attempt against saddam hussein was handpicked and funded by the u s government and he still reports directly to the cia iraqi politicians and intelligence officials in baghdad said last week immediately after the elections in january several iraqi officials said u s forces stashed the sensitive national intelligence archives of the past year inside american headquarters in baghdad in order to keep them off limits to the new government

you say bush will spend bn on the disater in fact he will not spend a single penny the belief that he will is a common misconception there is many a slip between money allocated and cash recieved poverty and need does not mean a deficiency in accommodation food water transport or security it means a financial deficit in cash people died in the hurricane all of them were poor no social worker died in the hurricane it will cost bn to process the corpses and all that cash will go to the wealthy cash would have saved all their lives but none all of it would have gone to the poor people are either concerned about poverty or gannets nobody can be concerned about poverty and gannets whatever food goes to a gannet does not get to the poor nobody can have their cake and eat it either the poor can be fed or the gannets who hang around them distributing services all governments should produce properly audited accounts detailing the disparity between cash designated and cash recieved poverty relief broadly concieved is grand larceny on a massive scale sustaining a flock of gannets half the size of the whole population and guess what they all happen to work in the public sector the same sector which recieves the taxation distributed

piltdown the us signed a convention outlawing all chemical weapons in yes but this is another of those moot points like napalm and white phophorous etc ie the use of the chemical is not specifically aimed at people eg the dioxin example was to clear forestation people become collateral damage or should not be in the area or should not eat the fish or drink the water or eat the plants etc contaminated by dioxin depleted uranium etc nor should civilians be around when cluster bombs are used nor should children play with them nor should people especially civilians and children step on land mines which are only sown to kill the enemy and so on and so on i suspect we have a long way to go in controlling some of the more horrendous weapons of war j j

the big winner is iran the big loser is the bush blair neo con israeli doctrine of using overwhelming military force to deal with terrorists iran has won both in gaza lebanon and iraq precisely because there is democracy there iran supports organizations that have popular support the governments there cannot say we do n t like the groups supported by iran perhaps under presure from the us so we are going to close them down that can only happen in egypt jordan and in saudi arabia iran has also validated their military doctrine hezbollah s military wing was trained by iran and they performed pretty well against israel also the bunkers designed by iran were able to withstand israeli bombardments this means that iran s revolutionary guard would perform well in a war against the us if the us attacks iran then that will trigger a repeat of the lebanon war but now on a much larger scale iran will fire missiles at the oil installations in the gulf the us will try to stop that using air power but that wo n t work they would then have no choice but to invade iran ultimately the us will be forced to sign a humiliating cease fire with iran

boydavey it is my belief that there are people at work doing their level best to undermine our alliance as if we dont have enough problems but i do think our medias play a role and i think the bbc is considerably guilty of this this debate regarding kyoto were the constitutional legalities ever once mentioned in articles as to why the presidents polar opposites like clinton and bush of the us didnt sign have states rights ever been mentioned or is that new information for you not being antagonistic just wondering i sometimes think the intracacies of our government and separation of powers are confusing to our european cousins no not a comment on intelligence simply because the easy article and the one that will get the most notice is the one that claims that we are anti environment not world team players imperialistic capitalist pigs with no care for the world around us so the core of the matter is glossed over and reduced to impressive sound bites and catch phrases that further the divide what started out i am guessing as a movement to assert the eu as a world power akin to the us has instead had the effect of empowering muslims worldwide into thinking that europe literally hates americans unfortunatley travelling there and reading a lot of foreign press has had the same effect on a lot of americans americans

the litany of crimes against humanity by contempory religious extremists is a long one lets not get into a petty debate of which one is longer why not in fact we should be debating just that rather than ignoring it which religion do you think is most associated with contemporary terrorism which religion was invloved in the air india bombing grant canadians died didnt they grant our fellow citizens sikhs and the trial was a farce but that was then and we re dealing with another religion now had sikh terrorism continued then we should be condemning them also

way of life that would indicate it is the daily norm do you know how many total high schools and universities there are in the us yes these events are tragic but certainly not the norm if that were the case or if it were a way of life you would hear about it happening a dozen times a year not a few times over the course of a dozen years to say something is both yearly and annual is redundant but please provide the factual data to back this up please list the last years lets say and list the way of life school shootings for each of those years as i understand it youth violence is on the rise in the europe specifically in the uk where its being reported that gangs are becoming increasingly violent and beginning to use more handguns are you saying your government does not allow you to assess your own mental stability how do they stop you have they implanted surveillance chips into your brain which is why you no doubt felt the need to be on your soap box about it and you make this statement on a poll that you conducted amongst most americans data gathered from the same poll no doubt doubt
ethnic cleansing apartheid what s the matter stuck for atrocity no because for me words have meaning avigdor liberman for example is an outspoken supporter of ethnic cleansing and other treatments involving busses and he is israel s deputy pm is n t he perhaps you could start by explaining how israel is an apartheid state with between and million israeli arabs er what is your point sa had millions of blacks you ca n t have apartheid without someone to be apartheid against the point is that the extreme gang who form the israeli government whose nominal head is facing rape charges whose pm is up against corruption and whose deputy pm is known even in his own country as a supporter of ethnic cleansing distinguish and give different rights to jewsih and non jewish citizens the palestinians have no rights at all though they are compelled to pay israeli taxes etc no israeli even disputes this did you see the arab palestinian supporters injured while rioting in jerusalem they were treated by israeli medics and hospitals how does that fit with apartheid do you know how many non jews are allowed to join the israeli police force do you know who the head of the force is and all the senior officers do you know non jewish citizens of jerusalem are being slowly ethnically cleansed fromt he city perhaps you should try learning something something

i do n t know why the catholic hierarchy crucifies itself with this decades long sex obsession ever since the advent of easily available contraception for all in developed countries contraception is used by almost all catholics else why would family size be so low my catholic mother in all other respects fully observant used contraception from the early s on to limit her family to without feeling her adopted faith compromised the hierarchy here has had to turn a very blind eye to lay practice and the laity has had to make its own peace with god about this sidestepping the clergy focus on this issue has undermined the authority of the church and attempting to shore it up in africa is going to fail too talk about flogging a dead horse the use of condoms in the context of aids is a health issue and could be justified even by the catholic hierarchy on that basis any contraceptive effect being an unfortunate side effect just as say treatment for cancer might involve a person becoming sterile as a side effect no one argues that they should n t be treated for cancer on account aids is just as deadly deadly
i certainly am familiar with the responses general they are trotted out frequently and repeated ad infinitum as though they have some sound reasoning behind them it is better if we were to tackle those issues individually though and perhaps have a greater perspective on what happened of course all these picayunities are secondary to the important central issue which was to take out saddam hussein no wmd s first it was not only tony blair who believed saddam had wmds you do know that right but do you also know that it was incumbent on saddam hussein to demonstrate openly that he not have wmd that he had to comply with the un resolutions that he comply with the restrictions brought in after gulf that he must allow unfettered access to inspections that he had wmd in the past used it in the past and was intent on developing wmd let s look at this issue first and then move on ok ok

they did not vote for the appeasers if you remember the right wing government tried to blame eta and the people knew they were lying the islamic jihad literature al queda tapes and arabic messages might have had something to do with it only fools would have supported such a government who lied to their people and presented false intelligence oh i ve just remembered blair s dodgy dossier and bush s presentation presentation
john mne thanks for your illuminating post i now realise only muslims kill fellow muslims in times of war and conflict let s face it the and world wars where nearly million people died were also muslim killing muslim plus the spanish civil war falklands war and a few others were muslim only affairs what s your point poindexter poindexter
yes of course anything positive about the israeli people has to be dismissed as propaganda look at the title of this thread grant which is also the headline of the linked media article does it say israel treats young iranian cancer sufferer or something like that no it does n t it and the linked article is a challenge to iran s president i m not making a negative judgement here on the israeli medics or the israelie of iranian extraction who made this possible that was good humanitarian work but i think it is fair comment to say that this thread and the associated media articles are propaganda
hi mistressofmydomain mistressofmydomain quote glad to see our friends to the north are wondering about the hypocricy of the us not going to darfour but have failed to wonder at the hypocricy of the un with sudan on the human rights commission not friends to the north but one equivalent of a euro lefty in toronto he is not speaking for all canadians but just our anti all things american loonies btw i would take him apart myself but its close to in the sandbox and time to head home besides you guys doing a pretty good job of bashing him on your own warmest regards smoker smoker
i will condemn suicide bombings of course but i will also condemn the israelis when they kill palestinians my condemnation will always include both anyway enough of your deflection as i said i am half iraqi and i am more concerned about the invaders in iraq more than the conflict between the pals and israelis i ll leave that to you and your fellow israeli fanatics fanatics
let s say los angeles is hit obliterated gone would you be one of those who would prefer it if the us did nothing what if london was hit and when did we go to war with iran
oh i see right ok
yeh lets criticise america lets not bother to criticise indonesia or saudi arabia yeh
looks unlikely to me syria does not have a strong military force in case of war iran will target the british base in basra and us bases elsewhere in iraq using missiles
despite concerns what can they possibly expect it seems those changes bho promised might be coming to pass but they ll probably limit him to one term as a result
george tenet has aired out the dirty drawers of the bush administration in his book at the center of the storm the ex cia chief takes the blame for the erroneous national intelligence estimate in that was used to justify the iraq invasion remember when you write an estimate when you estimate you re writing what you do n t know he said in retrospect we got it wrong partly because the truth was so implausible tenet reveals the bush administration had already concluded iraq was going to face consequences before the estimate was finished in he recalls running into richard perle at the white house on sept perle said to me iraq has to pay a price for what happened yesterday they bear responsibility i remember thinking to myself as i m about to go brief the president what the hell is he talking about he also writes there was never a serious debate that i know of within the administration about the imminence of the iraqi threat tenet claims dick cheney wanted to handpick iraq s leaders after saddam s fall and limit the country s involvement this was despite proclaiming publicly that establishing a democratic government was among the reasons for the invasion cheney and pentagon officials pushed for a ruling coalition that included ahmed chalabi kurdish leaders and exiled hussein opponents rather than risking an open ended political process that americans could influence but not control they wanted to be able to limit the iraqis power and handpick those iraqis who would participate you had the impression that some office of the vice president and dod reps were writing chalabi s name over and over again in their notes like schoolgirls with their first crush tenet writes a href http news bbc co uk hi world americas stm news bbc co uk hi a a href http www centredaily com story html www centredaily com a a href http www denverpost com sportscolumnists ci www denverpost com s a href http www denverpost com sportscolumnists ci www denverpost com s a

i notice that sch s comment did not include the number injured in gun massacres in american schools i just do n t get it can t you and the others simply say how utterly horrific it is for kids at schools to hurt anyone instead of throwing entire cultures under the bus what purpose does that really serve besides the old beating ones chest ranting out loud loud
did you happen to check out georgia cowardly dumps its military hardware nope grant got stucked in reading their forum very funny btw speakin of what i ve seen on other russian russian language sites recently ex military fellas criticizing this latest georgian adventure for exposing malfunctioning of regular russian army they failed some basics like taking out anti aircraft georgian fire power russian troop losses too high considering the superiority in numbers over georgia etc if one doesnt speak russian he she misses half of the fun internet can bring
strangely enough the grandchildren have embraced both cultures i believe that to be my doing doing
as far as the iraqi casualty figure it is a max civilian casualties caused by military intervention well that s ok then gw cretin will only face murder charges
i doubt even bush s most zealous supporters would agree that his political career was helped along by nepitism at least to some degree the family name was probably helpful in order to get started but after that he had to prove himself just as they all do his father only completed one term while the son served two two
what difference does it make whether the book is a religious tome george bush fervently refers to freedumb and damnocrasy when his marine massacre civilians perhaps we should ban all of that that

kind of nice though of ia jamo to say so not many around here prepared to be as honest as that in fact i remember this mb lining up to condemn so convinced were they of a different verdict they ve all mostly typically hypocritically now switched to condemning the jury for not putting him to death thanks that was a brave move ia jamo ia jamo

almost as poorly is factually correct but irrelevant you are either going to deal with the thinly veiled attack on an entire nations education or you can join the mud slinging with purile arguments that actually enforce the original childish argument of the entire thread
i attribute it to what i argued above in spite of talk about the beauty of diversity in the world i think many people fear difference many in the us like sports that those in other parts of the world do not understand rather than simply accept that people in other parts of the world have other preferences these people hate the differences not liking things you are not familiar with is typcially called prejudice i think it is telling that we in the us understand and accept that soccer is popular abroad while many abroad are simply unable to accept it is not all that popular in the us
as a human righ watch activist and danish muslim i have the obligation to defend those palestinians who have no voice on this board or even in any place it is time for israel to stop dreaming and come to reality in order to live in peace in the heart of the arab world i am anit semitic but yes anti zionist you know the diffrence don t you

ianpeter abbas s condemnation is sickening considering he recently passed a lwa granting the families of suicide bombers monthly compensation and israel s responce olmert says he s ready to hold final status negotiations probably an election ploy i hope otherwise it looks like israel s to be led by another incompetent left wing gov t
by the way lacewing do you have any quotes from any of these people to support what you say did you know that there are muslims who are at war with you look on the bnp s and other similar organisations websites grant you ll see what i mean well some muslims may like to think they at war with me if that s the case i treat them like i treat any other religious nutters i just treat them as deranged criminal lunatics you in effect make sane their insanity by arguing against them on their own terms your hero dubya played their game by declaring war on them a fat lot of good that has done
gothicdumster your lot tried the same trick on galloway btw and he s still there more popular by the minute while your zionist bootlickers like blair are on the way out lo l was n t blair re elected despite the war was n t bush re elected was n t australias john howard re elected when was gallows this way george elected into office next you ll be saying the mcb isa respectable organisation
steady on there i do n t think there s any support for terrorism nor killing innocent people including women and children in any holy book of any religion if you re not familiar with the koran just withdraw from any debate but do n t draw incorrect assumptions on something with which you obviously know nothing about in fact there are many such references in the koran and a little research would tell you as much
stuart it s certainly one of the theories doing the rounds along with theory that the boy was n t even killed i have n t heard this theory or read about it anywhere have you got a link what was i saying about wacko theories again a simple question who gains more when palestinian children are victims what does israel gain nothing whereas for the palestinians its a huge propoganda score the fact is that the palestinians kill their own for propoganada and the al dura incident simply exposes this
it s jail not a holiday camp
i agree with you it seems an intelligent tourist industry allows its guests to either immerse fully in part or not depending upon the guest that is why the ugly american charges have always confused me by the way i became a vegetarian living in hong kong in the late s there were many very good and very chinese buddhist and secular vegetarian restaurants on lantau island where i stayed at that time china had few places to match even average hong kong restaurants i imagine that has changed over the past years

so we can attack anybody we dont like yes we can pre emptively attack someone who threatens world peace wrt the western world someone from the me might think that about western countries or israel its just that we have bigger and better weapons and so we will pre empt any ideas they have as opposed to a neo conservative christian fundementalist country they like it that way that s called democracy
almost of americans disapprove of what bush is doing in iraq if they all emailed and phoned their senators and congressmen demanding the impeachment of the oil grabbing warmonger in the white house or they wo n t get voted back next time i think they would listen dirty dickie nixon was forced to resign because he was a liar and since bush s lies have caused many thousands of innocent deaths he surely deserves imoeachment at least before he goes to jail jail
its simply enough to state that the palestinians never implemented the first act of the roadmap roadmap is n t a parallel process its a sequence the sequence starts with the palestinians renouncing terrorism and incitement and disarming the terrorists since they never did that then they killed the roadmap i do n t have to refute anything else

the problem with isreal now is that it feels the need to retaliate first before assessing the consequences of such action it also expects the usa to back it up whenever it does take action unfortunately in many instance the us has done just that now i feel the usa has to step back and side with the vast majority of the world in condemning this military action i would have thought it clear that hezbollah is usuing the propaganda value of the violence to suit their cause isreal are in the wrong here the focus of the violence and effect has switched from the kidnapped soldiers to the dead and injured civilians collatoral damage is the biggest hammer hezbollah has now to show the savagery of the isreali response
the excuse blame everything on islam and the muslims who go to heaven and get virgins didnt just come out of blue now imagine if the world found out that both chritians in palestine and infact iraq are equally fed up of being killed by forgein armies which excuse would the civilzed democratic leader use to justify the occupation and murder

hyper so the french fought the british over north america does n t make it right the british or jewish immigrants had no right over that land and the arab colonists did because it knew about zionism and the fact the most the jews at the time were recent migrants so had no right to claim it they had no right to marach in and steal it you ve already expressed your anti semetism about this quite well no need to keep repeating yourself the arabs were not a colonial power just by repeating it does n t make its true so the arabs did n t come from arabia a mainly arab region should be run by arabs in what way is that colonialism and please do tell us how the middle east became arab like the french in north america for a large part were unsuccessful unlike the jews at kicking the british out the colonists were the european jews trying to kick out the british ie colonists for colonists who were the jews colonists for and i have explained how this was originally colonialism but they assimilated with the locals so they too became arabs so and not arabs ruling over middle easterners ah so the arab colonialists ethnicly cleansed the natives raped them sorry dated them and assimilated with them and one morning they all became happy arabs lovely the fact the arabs did n t rule the place makes it impossible for them to be colonialists as colonists need power the arab colonialists colonised and then were colonised they ca n t complain if this is so unfair they could all go back to arabia jewish migration though turned a majority arab place into a jewish place and only an anti semite would object to this should we hand australia or the us back to the natives because you keep claiming that lack of arab land ownership was a problem in them claiming soverignty is n t the the case as shown in sa erm no sa is a sovereign but the formation of israel was based on a very recent wave so would be like muslims claiming parts of britain this is getting so tedious and boring briatain is a sovereign what is it about this word you ca n t get your head around around
spain is on the list however the terrorist believe they are playing ball right now and thus do not appear to want or need to attack there at this time this however is my personal opinion and is a speculation drawn upon my observations of their al qaeda sites i do n t like the fact they are going under the water so to speak and i had read bin laden s orders earlier i posted many times of his objective to strike london he said he would do this twice then he would hit in the month of august with a chemical attack you have the right to know this information

your definition of palestine keeps changing sometimes it includes the whole area sometimes it does n t exist at all so there is no doubt after mandate palestine was reduced to the area that currently consists of israel west bank and gaza on creating the mandate the lebanon syria and jortdan were also part of the area called palestine but renamed to those country names hence the only area that can be called palestine now is west bank and gaza this area was equally granted as the jewish national home and a place where arabs can live and until it becomes an official state with a constitution recognised government and the institutions of state such as legislature etc then it is still palestine and still subject to the mandate so the question still remains where is the lebanese palestinians home
the oldest prejudice of them all anti semitism is on the rise once again i m not sure whether it s the oldest but it s very strong judiasm is the oldest monotheism in the world if you discount the egyptian aten worshippers and this should be understood believers in one god to the exclusion of all others are fundamentalists it is one thing to believe something but when to do so is contingent on complete dismissal of all other peoples beliefs the result is arrogance islam amp christianity also suffers from this in it s most extreme form

antineocon whilst i agree with practically everything you have said on this and many other threads i must correct you on this post i am s african not a white man either during the liberation struggle it was mainly jews within the white population who helped us many paid a high price for their efforts mandela s lawyer during the rivona trial was a jew he helped the anc big time until he was murdered by boers dennis goldberg spent years in prison with nelson he visited the zionist experiment and was ashamed by what he saw fellow jews doing jews in sa have a proud record during the liberation movement and i will take issue with anyone who claims otherwise i can list many of them who died or were jailed for their conscience dont let these fools on here and their myopic love for the zionist experiment in whatever activity it does cloud your own conscience btw you are spot on about the accent the jewish accent in sa is gutteral gutteral

wait to see if there is peace the most succesful peace process in near memory is northern ireland which was n t done by reciprocating civilian deaths this is just covering a plaster for a sinking ship it was probably a hitler style take over with people voting for them hamas increasing their power by force regretting it afterwards hamas do not palestinans and civilians should not be treated as such israelis response is supported by the israelis whic is more worrying

hi bouncy helen irony is lost on you it appears i really do n t care what happens to corner shops or their relationship with the big retailers it simply seems to me that this issue more than most perhaps is something that can be left to people to decide for themselves i note that you have avoided all my questions regarding the correct level of employment within the retail sector or why it would be a good thing for the retail sector to become more labour intensive your point does not follow that if tesco is very profitable then it must be poor value your position in general illustrates why regulators should stay out of market decisions perception of value is the result of a myriad of factors given varying weight by a myriad of individuals i for instance am well aware that the tesco s fruit amp veg aisle represents mediocre value and is none too pleasant to boot however my time is valuable and i do n t always get the opportunity to go to my favourite fruit and veg store i feel guilty about this nothing i ca n t handle and do it anyway others may like the fact that they are shopping at a big trusted name others may like the fact that what they want is always in stock or that there is a relatively hasslefree returns section basically so what if they are more efficient in labour terms do you have any other sectors which you would like to see become more labour intensive i presume also that you will be pressuring government to curb internet shopping for the same reason personally i look forward to the day when wal mart cuts a swathe through the whole lot of them yours gavin
at least in our nations where it isnt sanctioned by the state the victim has some recourse and can have some action taken the women and children lost in the nations cannot speak out nor can their families human beings are bad all over but if the rule of law is that honor killing is acceptable it will happen with greater frequency and no consequences so it really isnt the same sanctioning is just another way of approving if you cant see the difference then you really are indoctrinated beyond hope

however you are trying to wash your hands of that responsiblity by hiding behind a country of your citizenship which is not nato then let me assure you you have chosen a side of those who are quite comfortable with criminals as their allies so that when criminals commit crimes you would readliy go hysteric about the crimes and the criminals and forget the people who make criminals job easy who should my allies be those who for whatever their faults may be try and help the people of afghanistan such as the nato or those like you for whom there will never be a reason strong enough not to attack children an movement cult with an idiology that finds the basest human actions and makes them their prized aims and goals an idiology that has found a home within one of the major religions and scewed and twisted it to meet their hunger passion and lusts for harming the weakest in the world you are a prime example my friend of the threat that we in the world whether muslim christian jew or buddhist atheist or whatever men women and children face a group of misfits who have been brainwashed to believe that it is ok to attack and sell children because their friends also do so and that makes it ok in the west such people are found and and their rings smashed but in your world it is a task for brave men this attacking of the weak i know who my allies should be unfortunately the poison that seeps from the saudi desert poisons every well in the world and one day these brave men will have to face real men and then they will be exposed as the evil weaklings that they are

jews may not be the only ones who make insults to islaam but jews often instigate the remarks and opinions by way of them using pressure groups to silence anti jewish comments whilst promoting and funding anti muslim right wing neo cons in the media but the thing is with billion muslims across about muslim countries around the world who cares what the jews think they have a tiny bit of land in the middle east which is shrinking and the rest they have is just space on our airwaves and in the papers papers

i d agree with that there is no single jewish accent in this country although there are jewish ways with the language both in use of expressions and in tone of delivery in some cases this is entirely to be expected i note that many british born asians still carry a hint of their parents accented english into the next generation also equally there are many second generation immigrants out there speaking english no different from their true brit compatriots now an israeli accent that s another thing entirely unmistakable and totally different from the jewish accents heard here a bit pointless really this thread we could just as easily be discussing french and welsh accents for what it s worth worth

for the hundredth time they were not jailed for speaking their minds they were jailed for inciting others to kill people and incidentally their own speech comprised of threatening with violence other people who might wish to exercise free speech that s an act of intimidation others into silence not of universal free speech it s not free speech for a to say to b that if b draws a cartoon b should be killed it s simply an incitement to murder designed to suppress the free speech of others that s the sort of veiled threat we have become very used to hearing in britain large numbers of the british public have tired of it because one set of dark mutterings is followed by another the cartoon protests here took place in a country where the media and government had not published the actual cartoons in case of more outraged muslims the response of the people in question was not to say thank you for your consideration but to go out calling for our beheading annihilation extermination etc anyway that is to say whether one appeases or confronts such people they will always make angry threats that s why it is better to meet them head on if these cases had not been brought and the authorities only did so after massive public anger then the next such protest would almost certainly have resulted in a huge riot and deaths if it were to have reached that stage then you and the other cheerleaders for the cartoon protesters here would have had to grasp that provoking an angry minority is as nothing in terms of danger compared to provoking an angry majority what on earth your own purpose is in trying to stir the pot i do n t know know

this is what i submitted to have your say the north koreans do n t need the bomb for protection because they already have china as an ally having the bomb serves as a deterrence against us military involvement should kim jong il start to press his expansionist aims in the region this also explains why the north korean government are so keen to promote news of the test a nuclear exchange remains unlikely but the probability of conventional conflict in the korean peninsula has definitely increased of course it did n t get published i hate fully moderated a k a hys censorship mechanism but with only characters there s plenty of stuff that did n t get expounded on kim jong il s frustration is that he ca n t use his massive army without incurring a us military response but the bomb implies massive us casualties up front i doubt if the us congress would have backed the invasion of iraq if they d ve known it meant dead it s only that the casualties have been incurred over a few years that has numbed their power to shock the us population intelligence from post iraq indicated that saddam did n t think he was wrong to have invaded kuwait just that he should have waited to acquire the bomb first of course china is unhappy with kj i but they would still probably stand by nk in the event of a military incursion by others i also doubt they would actually attack nk in the event that pyongyang precipitate a conflict i e invade sk

your only concern is whether he said praise jesus point was that all religions inspire extremisim including christianity that you are so fond of my concern is twofold the first is that you lied in attempt to make a point of some sort the second is that you equated the bombing of a building with the murder of hundreds of kindergarten students in breslan russia both are inexcusable even if the phrase was never documentated doesnt change the fact that christianity was the source which was the point of the statement then that is what you say not lying in order to defend the indefensible do you really believe you can make statements like that and get away with it is that clear enough transplanted canadian or do you need to consult your priest born and raised in canada formula fan and never felt the need for any religious leader but despite this lack of religious instruction i still do n t lie

oh dear simon comes onto these boards and talks about the million dead of world war ii and blames it on christians fact not all of the combatants were christians fact six million of the victims were jews people of all religions and none fought on both sides it was n t a religious war is that so and that would be because it does n t suit you to characterise it as such the hatred that saw the jews put to death that had nothing to do with centuries of christrainanti semitism nd when it comes to islamic jihad he obviously ignores the million plus non muslims killed in total by islamists simply for being infidels islamist moslems jihad infidels a latin catholic word but hey lets stretch a point can i respectfully ask if you know the meaning of any of them
you claim jesus is not the son of god that s pretty insulting to christians christians
that did n t seem to worry britain and europe when it faced conquest by the nazis when it needed loans and donations to rebuild the continent when it needed protection from stalin i d sooner these people as allies than the sort of people the far left associate with
if the catholic church is being criticized for its cover up of the abuse of women and children for example then that is the same motivation as racism to you it springs from the same source the fact that people might be legitimately outraged disappointed or otherwise critical of this behaviour is of secondary importance to you first the racism behind such charges must be dealtwith but catholics are not characterised as a race as moslems are judaism is a religion does that mean the nazis were only making a religious judgement one need n t be a conservative to have a regard for language words and their meanings and yes technically they are very correct except that conservbatives see moselms as a race and frequnetly use the anti semetic language of the s to criticise islam this is why such criticism is frequently anti semetic to not be allowed to be critical of others is surely a racist attitude it suggests that these people are less than adults and must be treated with kid gloves like children criticism is one thing anti semetism another are jews children because grant et al will not criticise them the fact is that every person society culture and religion can be criticized and we should not withhold this criticism because we feel them to be inferior or immature but when this cricism as it does descends into racism and is fueled by hatred and ignorance is hitler s verbal critiques of judaism to be allowed responding to legitimate criticisms of any group with charges of racism is probably the lowest form of debate and denigrates further the group under discussion whereas to characterise people of a certain religion as belonging to some vast conspiratorial group all of whom think and feel the same is what enlightened debate debate

why am i not surprised at the democrats being blatantly politically partisan and opportune over this deal sitting back and criticising bush for sitting back and letting them there nasty arabs from dubai buy into american ports it stands to reason it would undermine security does n t it you would never get democrats agreeing to a thing like that would you no us security would be safe with them hillary has certainly been quick of the mark c she has made her opposition clear but if these arabs are so untrustworthy why are gore and carter and various other democrats and of course good old bill c so happy to associate themselves with them a href http www canadafreepress com cover htm www canadafreepress a well maybe it s not quite so straightforward after all c but maybe all our democrat supporting friends on this board can explain it to us myself i like the last sentence c talk about shades of tessa tessa

forget the usa we want to join winners not loosers and which countries waiting in are the winners this response demonstrates that the eu to many is a hodgepodge collection of countries more determined to be anti american than to have any long term plans and goals encouraged and supported by the electorate the united states certainly does n t feel threatened by the eu why would they the us response to these shenanigans like most of the non european world is largely one of indifference if europeans can convince themselves that they are winners and the american people loosers then they can believe that and join whatever organization they want that will encourage their self esteem meanwhile the rest of the world can only sit back and watch with amusement and a wee bit of apprehension for the long term term
dear thread contributors i repeat religions do not commit wrongs people and governments do the most unconstructive practice on this board and wider is the attack on religions c for the hell of it atrocities which are committed in the name of religion are committed by people who often use religion as a reason c the crusade atrocities have often been re examined in this light relgions actually go wrong when they have leaders sub leaders and sub sub leaders not the opposite if religion were truly personal and individual as it should be then the world would have billion or so religions with no leader or peer group pressure interpreting their religion for them then the world would be just as rotten if most people were evil but much better if most people were good i think most people are good be they of the so called or world religions atheists or disinterested just a personal thought m m

the situation in ulster is very different it is n t about scots and irish for one thing the settlers were a mixture of scottish presbyterians and mainly english anglicans there have always been sizeable movements of populations between ireland and scotland indeed the scots originated in scotland true that the scots have a large amount of norse ancestry but so do the irish and if you look at ulster s populations although mostly the presbyterians are of scottish ancestry there has been a lot of mixing and many roman catholic s of scots ancestry and protestants of long standing irish ancestry it is n t a scots irish issue there are also no ancestral qualifications to joining any of the denominations involved since the creation of the state of eire those perpetuating violence have mostly been trying to fight for an all ireland marxist state in opposition both to the state of eire and to not just the unionists in ulster but also many nationalists too more recently the violence in ulster has focused against members of their own communities and is mere gangsterism and hooliganism having nothing to do with politics or religion

i just do n t understand all this bellicose talk of how tough iran is and how if the coalition failed in iraq then it ca n t make a success of disarming iran s nuclear weapons israel just showed that with a few planes it can scupper syria s nuclear plans it did teh same with saddam s ambitions with a few planes and missiles the coalition of europe israel and the usa would devastate iranian ambitions in a an hour all you need is stealth and big bombs there would be no ground invasion it would be an air war syria s air defences and radar just switched itself off when israel attacked no retaliation was met my guess is that iran is all talk and no substance and the secret services know it no one will allow them to reach a point of no return
well i guess you have me there colonel previous to your post i had always thought that it was quite taboo for a muslim woman to be an officer in the military thus putting her in a position to be a superior officer and have power over thousands of men i recall when khadafi received such criticism in the muslim community for appointing a woman as one of his body guards but i am always open minded and willing to learn and thus grow and change so can you please give me some examples of high ranking women military officers currently leading armies as colonels and generals do in muslim countries many thanks thanks

if the government is corrupt should n t there be some oversight rather than have it continue yes but how does that have any bearing on the issue there is nothing to stop that oversight being subject to democratic control if people are willing to fight and die for democracy surely trying to contain a corrupt leadership through changes in the bureaucracy might be more acceptable than replacing an entire government it might be and it might not it would depend on what those changes meant for people whose democracy is involved are you only willing to accept perfect democracies throughout the world hart your position is ridiculous grant since a willingness to accept imperfect democracy should never replace a preference for perfect democracies or surpress criticism of imperfect ones if only you eurolefties would complain as much about dictatorships the world might advance at a more rapid pace than it is at the moment and those people living under these corrupt government might attain peace and prosperity some time sooner than they are now that is nothing more than a feeble generalising and hypocritical strawman from you grant who is very selective about your criticism of dictatorships based on your own small minded and bigotted prejudices your arguements might have more merit if you could demonstrate that you have the least clue about functioning democracy however on these boards you have demonstrated time and again that prattle well beyond your understanding the eurolefties are always complaining about any advances in democracy while insisting on it for themselves more baseless tripe from you grant and risible in the fact that the op is about the lack of an advance in democracy interestingly that s under threat on your home threat also that s nothing more than a fantasy of yours grant

i am an unabashed zionist and proud supporter of israel i have in the past had two significant events in my life where i interacted with muslims and arabs in one i worked for a year with feisal eighteen inches to my right and muhammad eighteen inches to my left both were of indian extraction one being pakistani and the other indian the other experience was where i worked for six months in a small company that was entirely staffed by lebanese both christian and muslim the two owners with whom i worked closely everyday were a lebanese christian and a muslim syrian with just about all of these people i participated in completely engaging but civil debate muhammad and i had a lot of fun as he was a huge cricket fan and taught me the ins and outs but he was apolitical feisal was an observant muslim of a liberal sect we traded a lot of details about life in a mosque in comparison to life in a synagogue he was a bona fide genius i think and he also opened my eyes to issues vis vis the muslim world and the u s a the syrian was a brilliant man extremely well versed in contemporary history he had me really working hard and i had to re examine a lot of previously conceived notions i had by the way all without exception were western educated not necessarily in western institutions but rather in the western tradition i like to think i am an intellectually honest person i invite you to travel the link to my posts to examine my arguments this has been my experience i have met here some rabid pro zionists whose posts i personally find embarrassing the rabid anti zionists seem to be an order more vitriolic i can sense the blind hatred also they are easily frustrated with the simplest critical thinking there really is no debate here at all it is all quips based on self enforcing and cross referenced hate propaganda to even question its veracity brings immediate indirect fire as opposed to an actual response based on my own reading and research there is certainly a palestinian narrative of merit to say otherwise in my opinion is nonsensical i have participated in excellent debate and exchange of information here on these boards a fair number of times i have been challenged by posters comments that required me to stop and re examine my thinking always these have been alleged facts that i was not previously aware of and i spent the time researching the issue and verifying the facts a case on point is my discussion with ed regarding water usage in israel p territories without exception every post that i felt had merit and that i fact checked did not pan out some citations were to reputable pro palestinian sources that i had to delve a lot deeper into the primary source data un reports and the like a lot was just unsubstantiated myth mongering devoid of any sources at all some others were simply foolish i remember one citation that was to a headline to the effect of israel some atrocity i tried clicking the headline but there was no link no links anywhere on the page for that matter it was just a list of made up headlines i very strongly notice that all of the pro palestinian myth mongering is cross referenced each argument refers to other self documenting resources that refer back in a web of cross references then of course there is pallywood and fauxtography the arab muslim art of invented videos and photographs finally there are out and out lies that are apparent on their face ranting really i did my own research into the apparently endless list of israeli atrocities i found several clear acts of improper military behaviour but only a few i found some of unacceptable civilian behaviour towards palestinians then there is the government based acts an example of which is uprooting olive orchards finally there are actual war crime type atrocities for example the arab deaths in this category during the war as explained by the new historian benny morris now do i mean that palestinians are not killed not at all in my view the vast majority of so called atrocities war crimes genocide ethnic cleansing animal behaviour etc ad nauseam is related to the palestinian insurrection intifadah in the occupied territories of gaza and the west bank and the israeli attempts to manage and quell the insurrection these actions fall into a few categories clearing a designated military reserve of protestors quelling insurrection rock throwing etc immediate retaliation to armed attacks pro active attacks by the idf to degrade and destroy palestinian military capabilities ongoing border screening in other words i do n t deny the suffering of individual palestinians i both sympathize and empathize with the pain and suffering the two peoples are at war the idf will make every effort to avert collateral damage but civilians will get hit when a qassam stockpile is hit palestinians have to wait hours at the border but every parcel truck ambulance and person must be physically checked for suicide vests and ordinance smuggling only about of palestinian attackers get through that means for every bombing in tel aviv or jerusalem others were thwarted or caught at the border for better or worse until a final settlement is reached israel is responsible for the populations in the territories and for order and security violent insurrection cannot be allowed lest anarchy take hold as part of the occupation certain areas are classified by military authorities the justness of it or not is not my point when a soldier with a rifle under orders to clear the area tells you to do so one takes his life into his own hands to disobey when qassam rockets are fired into israel you can bet your grand mother s pearls that a bigger rocket is coming back your way for that matter if a palestinian fires rockets next to a civilian home he knows that the return fire may hit that home as well he ought to take responsibility for his choice what are eight year olds doing throwing stones at tanks intermixed with adults armed with assault rifles all of this is ongoing military operations between two peoples at war they are not acts of genocide or ethnic cleansing or anything like that with some exceptions i find most pro palestinian posters fall into one single pattern a two or three sentence post of unsubstantiated outrageous claims when one calls them out for evidence i have gotten the run around as i described above or just non answers i have been engaged in serious debate by pro palestinian supporters on these boards in only a small minority of instances i find that this profound penchant for dishonest debate is not so much acts of actual dishonesty rather it is part and parcel of the overriding arab social characteristic of face saving i e self deception that is as far as i can tell so long is face is saved publicly all is well prime examples of this are astounding claims of military victory in the face of catastrophic losses and on the verge of military annihilation by and large i find the scales of dishonest debate tips acutely toward the pro palestinian side side

people forget that under the geneva convention and universal laws on war conduct it is perfectly acceptable to attack your enemy where they live taking care to safeguard innocent people where possible targetted killings are acceptable to the west as much as jqack straw likes to pretend that its only israel who is not allowed to fo it targetting saddam at the start of the iraq war was one such incident where the uk thought it acceptable to target saddam
in fact the automobile continued rolling after all the shots were fired see my post above on whether shooting at a driver can be considered a sensible way to stop a driver actually no one may search far and wide and find occasional incidents where a person strong police force in a city of million with at least million visitors every day commits excessive force the reality is that the nypd has a very good record of not using excessive force and its record has improved over the years what is lost in this debate save for my post is that the nypd will review and severely rebuke the officers as soon as the federal civil rights actions are exhausted whether the officers go to jail or not the nypd cannot begin its own action until the various prosecutions are complete the nypd has not supported the officers here what statements it has made make clear it is leaning to finding the officers acted inappropriately

that s the point you would assume that without treatment the host organism dies but it turns out that antibiotics are used in humans where the disease being treated is not life threatening but merely inconvenient and where without treatment the human would develop immunity to the disease rather than the disease develop immunity to the treatment in animals antibiotics are used to increase yields and thus raise profits in the short term even though the use of them gives future generations of farmers the problem of seeing their profits reduced to zero or less

smoker surely you are not quite as daft as your message the americans want to control the oil to stop anyone else controlling it in particular their enemies thats why they are in alliance with saudi arabia and is why their worst nightmare would be if islamist extremists were to take control of saudi arabia the small states in the gulf are either in alliance with america or have american bases there or both you see america has to make sure it can get oil and on favourable terms thats whats meant by controlling the oil there is also the question of dollars vs euros thats a question i ll leave alone for the minute china is an expanding market for oil and american does want to make sure china doesnt get all the worlds oil for it would mean the yanks could n t drive around in their big humvees and that would never do cheers cheers

to the muslim world said barack obama in his inaugural address we seek a new way forward based on mutual interest and mutual respect and we apologise profusely for invading iraq and causing the death of innocent iraqis and causing million iraqis to be homeless now that s more like it besides its not about muslims its about the american forgien policy the policy evilize a group of people their beliefs and then destroy them the native americans african slaves england when it was the empire over north america and on and on an on if today muslims accept this apology look like thingie the americans will find a new enemy and do the same thing to them i think muslims have an opportunity to end this american value tradition and forgein policy
however the fact that the us had eliminated regimes in iraq and afghanistan but failed to replace them with stable political structures is of course blanking out the fact that there are fledgling governments in both those countries that will eventually overcome their difficulties if a think tank report slipped over into this kind of wishful thinking then it really should get a caning

that s a stupid analogy the arab middle east is millions of square miles israel is a tiny part of it a better analogy might be to say that suppose asians fleeing persecution in say africa had come to the uk which they regarded as a homeland to form a peaceful and prosperous minority but the english had decided to murder and expel them so the un had to step in and partition leicester for them to live in at which time armies from germany and france invaded to try and destroy leicester they tell the remaining english inhabitants of leicester to leave because it is going to be destroyed but the asians manage to fight them off it would have been much better for everyone if the ugandan asians had been allowed to settle peacefully oh wait they did and now they generate times as much gdp as the average person

of course it is zimbabwe just proves how sickeningly opportunist and false all the rhetoric from the iraq hawks about humanitarian intervention was the neocons in america and labour hawks here see nothing to gain by invading zimbabwe whereas there was much to gain by invading iraq saddam s human rights record was a smokescreen to hide the real motives of the iraq invasion invasion

i do not see this lone voice as daring to do anything it s very difficult to quantify the savagery in any meaningful sense it s true that in any community there are people who behave collectively and compassionately whilst there are those that do not this is no great revelation in itself a society that fosters individualism that favoured by the journalist is less likely to produce acts of solidarity a society neglected in run down housing schemes whilst being bombarded with images of wealth is likely to produce a degree of anti social behaviour a society that when a major storm hits is met with loaded guns to prevent looting one that is criminalised for being poor is likely to show inappropriate rage and anger the extent of this we really do n t know these are basic points but they are far from the mind of this journalist the point of the article is to make right wing points on the back of suffering suffering

is that a valid reason to abandon the iraqis to the tender mercies of al qaeda if the allied troops pulled out i fear iraq would fall to islamofascism in a very short time the foreign salafists are there entirely for the opportunity to have a pop at the americans there s no doubt that if the new shia rulers and baathists do n t make some agreements there will be continued civil conflict however although the american troops are keeping a lid on this violence they can neither solve it nor stop it

i would agree with this but only up to a point and the article is n t clear about this is it really as you say muslim only time if so i agree if as the article may be implying these times are accessible to women of any faith that wish to swim in these particular conditions then i disagree with you that it s segregation by ethnicity does anyone actually know by the way this just reminds me of a sad personal story years ago my mother was on an ulpan program rooming with a young palestinian woman and they became close friends at that time my mother was a big swimmer and availed herself of the swimming pool on a daily basis for exercise and heat relief after a number of months her friend asked if she could go with my mom early one morning and have my mom teach her how to swim they did this once and it resulted in verbal hostility from some arab men who happened to witness it she wore a very conservative by western standards of course one piece swimsuit and was careful to remain fully covered up until the last possible moment when entering and exiting the pool a day later the woman came to my mom in tears because the word had gotten back to her family in the west bank and they had phoned her threatening to remove her from the program if she did that again she went again this time even earlier to avoid being seen and even more careful with regard to modesty her family made good on their threat and she was gone in a matter of days and my mom was never able to contact her and to this day does n t know whether she received any of her letters or not or what became of her i do n t care what people wanna do with regard to modesty and dress in theory but i do object to legal adults being denied the right to make their own decision on what they want to wear in places where it s acceptable for others to dress the same ie if it s at a pool where swimsuits are accepted attire at that time

the point is that it was n t just jewish immigration that occured but massive arab immigration aswell and where exactly did i deny the fact that there was arab immigration i know there was both arab and jewish immigration but the jewish immigration far outnumbered the number of arabs who were coming into the region because unlike the jews there was a good number of arab s who fled the region as well this myth about palestinians having lived in the land for s of years is simply that a myth obviously you re completely ignoring everything i have said thus far the point here is there have always been muslim s in that region for the past years that have outnumbered the jews therefore the current palestinian s have had far more ancestors living over the past millenia then the number of israeli ancestors since most of them are all immigrants and therefore have no traceable family history in the region before the th century is there a library near you go and read from time immemorial by joan peters lol this alone explains why you have such a one sided and narrow minded view on this the fact that you rely on a book which is engineered towards promoting a tired old excuse which has been debated to death does you no favours whatsoever

meta etc so why did this incident create one of the biggest news stories this week and is the leading thread by number of posts was is the symbolism so deep serious stuff apart the pub jokes are still coming re eg does bush now have sole is the shoe on the other foot iraq arabs world wide put the boot in dead duck bush ducks joke bush jokes over the size of shoe thrown but what is the global symbolic size ok that s trite stuff but the effects of bush s war on iraq will continue long after he is gone and only time will tell whether is was worth bombing a country killing so many innocent people and destroying a country s infrastucture to despose sh and rid his country of wmd s and their threat to the usa lest you forget j

and i should trust them no one knows everything i know everything but do i want to enlighten your mind nope i was not encourged to passively receive information and i dont like others to lazily accept information without any proof on the bases of false evidence otherwise i would be a westerner and believed in the stories told by your leaders retold by your media and had actually believed that iraq had wmd or the stuff you are told everyday
that our perception is groomed by the media wether we think it is or not for me the mainstream media is guilty of many far reaching crimes perception crimes which in my book are no less important than war crimes themselves

i fervently hope that arnie does n t succeed i see no reason why gays should not have the same rights as straight people however i do n t really think that muslims are in a position to lecture wendymann nor britons the soon to be civil partnerships are not equal to the marriage that at least some us gays can enjoy
my mum had a book of reproductions of persian miniatures years ago and the paintings were gorgeous but mohammed was always shown without a face i think a couple of the pictures you ve linked to are the same although not all such a shame that the visual arts are so restricted in the islamic world if you are n t into calligraphy or ceramics you ve pretty much had it
gt gt the un was weakened by the us undermining it and invading iraq whilst the un protested hang on we re on top of this like the traffic warden performing a citizen s arrest on a drunk driver in the middle of questioning by specialist traffic police lt lt thats bull the un was weak before the un will continue to be weak the un would still be weak if the us did n t undermine it the us undermining it changed nothing with the un the corruption and do nothing un caused its own demise of course i m not surprised a democratic institution membered by non democratic states does n t make sense gt gt any time the us elects to whole heartedly support the un instead of sending haters to sit on it s assembly i am confident the un s credence will be restored lt lt translation the us does the work again the un continues to do nothing nothing

i think as political statements they are as valid as the danish cartoons if the danish cartoons are a matter of freespeech then so are these there is of course an important point to be made that is the holocaust should be open to debate it should be open to scrutiny since truth and an accurate account can be more valuable than an account that is denied access and may lead to prison if the koran should be open to critical analysis as most zionists insist then why not the holocaust
nothing happened to it except that the lebanese have decided not to exercise that right this is as i said before because they would happily see the end of hezbollah and can then hopefully rekindle the fire of economic growth and success and business acumen taht is inherrent in the character of every lebanese person i have ever met
each groups has its fanatics do n t tar all muslims with the same brush i do n t tar all moslems with the same brush what moslems are failing to understand though is that what is haram for them does not extend to non believers non of us are obliged to follow each others religion not in the uk anyway but we are all bound by the law i m not obliged to follow the rule of not making images of the phrophet any more than i am the rule of going to confession or not answering the phone on a saturday you just tarred all muslims with the same brush by not using the words some muslims and you did n t answer the question about the football match perhaps you would like retry retry

message re written i think you just make it up as you go along any economic system gives rise to a state that will uphold its interests are you saying that the us armed forces are not defending us capitalist interests of course i disagree this is a nazi trying to recruit people today the nazis will tailor language to gain populist support it s no use just giving a quote without allowing for context btw hitler was vehemently anti marxist by and his activity reflected that undeniably undeniably
i think you re being hypocritical john you attempt to dismiss any and all disagreement with your representation by pre empting a few potential counterpoints and denoting them go ing round in escalating circles thereby showing no willingness whatsoever to hear differing viewpoints as you prematurely belittle them with your again if you wish but that s precisely what you re doing going round in circles or at least that s how it appears to me in the absense of any apparent desire to go anywhere else israel have said that they were within their rights under the ceasefire to engage in this action and according to the first link iht that comes up from your google link made this clear before the action okay this is something you think was a mistake and perhaps you and certainly others might disagree and believe it s more than just a bad pr decision but an actual violation but the main point you re missing is that the ceasefire violation by hezbollah that israel is claiming it was responding to has not been used by israel as an excuse to abandon the ceasefire further than this action or presumably and reportedly any others like it from your beeb link israel insisted the truce held so where are you going let s even say we agree that it was a pr mistake what happens next is it an excuse for hezbollah to announce a complete disconnection from the ceasefire is it an excuse for the lebanese government to renege surely that gets it all back to where you suggest you do n t want it going round in circles right or is there something you have n t yet offered that would explain this apparent contradiction the bbc article you link to inadvertently touches on this further in parallel to this point and i think it s key to the conflict and unfortunately in much of the discussion going on it s being avoided the bbc s nick childs in beirut correspondent says the un s main concern is that the incident both highlights the urgent need for un reinforcements and will put off potential troop contributors because it projects an image of insecurity an image of insecurity it did n t have that before so the un s main concern is that any troops it might send will be aware of what s going on is that a sneaked snippet of the planned rules of engagement know as little as possible about the conflict and make sure any and all troops are given a false sense of security just to ensure that they will once again be nothing more than sitting ducks in the line of fire and these parallels emanate from the same underlying point illustrated above and again as we see from the lebanese defense minister also from the beeb article he said any rocket fired from lebanese territory would be considered collaboration with israel to provide a pretext for it to strike he said that if the un failed to give clear answers in response to the raid he might be forced to ask the cabinet early next week to halt the army deployment in the south so there we are that s the only result i can see of a discussion criticizing israel for this pr disaster excuse for hezbollah excuse for siniora and excuse for the un of course it warrants addressing but it s your purpose that will define how it s addressed and your address which will expose your purpose and at the moment it appears to be a desire to go round in circles and add your weight to the pr disaster

a very valid comment on a thread opened by one of our resident pro israel spinmeisters it kind of reminds me of the type of football fan who never seems to see players on his team foul or cheat but never fails to spot an opposition player doing the same thing this could be easily resolved if the pro israeli and pro palestinian posters agreed to keep their own pet trolls under control but of course this wo n t ever happen party line and all that that

the difference between the turkish situation and the nazi holocaust is that the ideology and administration in germany was removed by ww and prosecuted providing eventually for a measure of closure for germany and a separation of the modern federal republic from that era however in turkey the young turk revolution was central to the nationalist rather than religious nature of the armenian genocide and even after the governments takeover by ataturk massacres continued the genocide is intertwined with the birth of the modern turkish state and not something that can be blamed on the old ottoman authorities therefore recognition of the genocide imperils modern turkey in a way which neither germany or even japan have had to deal with add to this the treatment of the kurds by the turkish goverment all makes this a modern issue and not a historical one one
apparently so reluctant to share background information i don t divide this board s members into anti jews anti muslims anti us or anti europeans i do divide it into sincere posters and wum s but beyond that i tend to divide it into those with and without a sense of humour and for the purpose of this post into those who i know and don t know i find that background information particularly the sharing of it makes posters more real and i tend to debate with these real board members much as i would with colleagues over dinner or down the pub c whether we agree or strongly disagree is irrelevant do you have similar perspectives or do you think that what posters say and how they say it is more important than who or what they are j ps i appreciate this is hardly world news except to say i also believe that discussions between world leaders are also influenced by personal chemistry intangibles as much as by the various other key factors factors
a few years ago april a month after bagdad was invaded i told people at different news forum of this weird habit of americans stripping down the iraqi civilians and making them do things which you all saw when year later the scandal of abu gharib was made people noone believed me that was the day i decided some people do not deserved to be told the truth so threive in the lies of tony and goerge goerge

dag the arab plan is no good for israel it leave no room for negotiation like i said its a package deal no room for israel to negotiate on the borders of a future palestians state keeping jerusalem whole isnt an option keeping any settlements isnt an option keeping all or even part of the golan isnt an option and there must be a palestian right of return israel must negotiate with the palestians using the roadmap that means concesions from both sides not just israel and with syria that can be decided through future talks based again on negotiation not simply handing over of the golan like the arab plan would have israel do
when someone still has a mortgage on a now house many will just walk away just as what happened in the uk in the eighties they no longer have debtor s prisons and the lenders must suffer the loss if as you say that is the case in america and or canada it is not so simple in england if a property does n t realise the sum secured against it then the borrower is still liable to pay the difference and the absence of debtor s prisons does not negate that nor is it any guarantee that those who do n t fulfill their obligations wo n t see the inside of a prison current leniency toward personal bankruptcy may see some changes but that was not the case in the eighties and to my knowledge it was a busy time for bailiffs in many areas there is a correction going on in the housing market and it will be international it began over a year ago and people should have been paying attention again i ca n t speak for the us or canada but such a correction has been widely predicted here for a few years and whilst it may be international it is also likely to be regional in effect but if you are happy in your home and do n t have a large mortgage or are n t holding one then it really wo n t matter there s nothing in current predictions that are any concern to me

it is a regular tactic of yours to turn an expression of opinion into a question that gives a completely different version of that expression that s because i believe these statements are not thought through and contains fuzzy logic you seldom are able to respond to these questions but instead complain that they are asked on the other hand you offer statements i never made and pigeonhole me in positions that are n t mine while you may believe this to be honest i do n t i ll withdraw the remark with the understanding that you ll quote me directly in the future rather than trying to make a counterargument against me from memory memory

to aiejrlsk from you israel s medievil barbarism towards palestinians just who are the medievil groups here who resort to primitive and barbaric methods to kill israelis but those palestinian sucide bombers and those little children who become human bombs just to murder jews who they believe took their land and houses israel is today one of the most progressive and modern little states you could find and it is punishment for the arabs who call themselves palestinians that they cannot keep up with the development and advance in science technology and medicine which israel prides itself on achieving achieving

insightful one you are simply being dishonest they were told that they were to be executed immediately and blind folded and made to stand against a wall in front of firing squad and terrorised in other ways that is what we are told by the sailors and why do you disbelieve them this is not the uk government talking but private individuals i note you seem to have only a tenuous grasp on truth but perhaps others including these citizens have slightly higher standards than you you

hi colonelartist colonelartist quote trust me i knew my neighbors well and they knew me well but invasion makes people change for the worst if allowed to invade i can simply destroy both your or your neighbors work place and homes colonelartist quote it just takes three days to lay the foundations of anarchy if you have n t learnt from the first three days after invasion of iraq then you have n t learnt anything instead of talking about theoretical situations such as the usa being occupied in the st century why not talk about real life examples what we have learned in dozens and dozens of invasions and occupations the normal thing is to resist the invaders rather than spend the time killing your neighbors and ordinary civilians blowing up other ordinary civilians is not normal behavior for example many countries in asia were occupied by the japanese imperial army from china to korea to the philippines to thailand etc and the civilians under occupation never started blowing each other up in markets or temples etc when the us army occupied japan and other asian countries the japanese amp other civilians never started to kill each other nazi germany occupied most of europe and the europeans never started to kill each other then the russians occupied eastern europe and the allies western europe after the war and the civilians did n t start to kill each other after three days three years etc india was occupied by the british for years and years and the indians did n t suddenly turn on their neighbors and start killing them bulgaria romania greece macedonia etc were occupied by the ottomans and the civilians did n t turn on each other the muslims occupied spain for seven centuries and the spanish did n t start killing each other after a days or weeks or months or years etc tibet has been occulted by the chinese since the s and the tibetan civilians did n t start to kill each other however today we have attack after attack from ordinary muslims on other ordinary muslims in the market schools hospitals and mosques day after day in iraq so explain how this muslim on muslim violence is a western conspiracy so tell us all colonelartist just how this american jewish conspiracy works that forces or tricks the good muslims of iraq into killing each other just give up the background outline on how this conspiracy works so far you have just told us there is a western conspiracy that is causing this so no outline to us so we can see what you are referring to btw i would appreciate an answer from anyone what is this western conspiracy fro dag petersen who refers to it all the time or don t trust anyone etc anyone who can explain this american jew west conspiracy please step forward and do so because i am really curious to hear it outlined warmest regards smoker smoker

some clapped out conspiracy site quoting a mish mash of sources does not provide any evidence of anything and as for your own remarks some jews do not allow any other view than that very carefully manicured myth just how are people not allowing any other views historical research is available to all and historical resarch proves millions died and not just jews there is no myth there you are a good example of how hatred and bigotry lead to blindness blindness

simcha why does everybody say that israel is obligated to return to the pre lines when resolution says israel should return territories not all territory and this was inentilaly worded this way because the un never expected israel to return to the pre war borders and also the conditions for israel returning anything is in return for peace and the arabs recognising israel its a pity that you are so desperate to justify the annexing of the occupied lands it has to do with wider international law i suggest that you look at in context with those obligations if we are to so reliant on intent then the intent was of course for israel and palestine to occupy the same amount of land so why does israel not feel obligated to meet this requirement in fact why does israel deny a whole people the right to self determination and statehood it doesnt make sense for a people that regularly defines itself as being victims

unfortunately eyes wide open is actually eyes firmly shut if i do n t know that russia has carried out these extra judicial killings it s because no independent human rights organisation or journalist is allowed anywhere near the crime scenes and the killing you speak of in iraq is perpetrated by the terrorists you know the terrorists that blow up innocent civilians with car bombs every other day i note that you are very fussy with evidence in this case but so far unproven allegations against the cia are taken as fact when it suits your argument so far the allegations of torture against the cia are pure conjecture rules of engagement you describe are correct however how does one determine that a terrorist who is fanatical and may well have no regard for their own life let alone an american soldier s is no longer a threat welcome to the cold harsh reality of urban warfare if any american soldier has taken it upon themselves to deliberately kill or harm innocent civilians then those soldiers in question should be brought to justice and no doubt will be if any solid evidence is available

mr silver princess diana was killed in a car accident she would be alive today is she was wearing a seat belt there is so much evidence that hitler killed himself in his bunker that i am amazed you even raise the question arafat was sick ill and died simple as that and oswald killed kennedy some might take all the conspiracy theories seriously until you finally realise how people can turn a straight forward thing like two planes flying into a building and turn it on its head into the most unbelievable bizarre theories imaginable if they can do that with the wtc attacks then we should not be suprised that the kennedy assasination attracts such comment comment

ok let me rephrase it in britain arabs and muslims are generally accepted as friends if they are routinely spoken of as enemies in america then the americans doing this are being racist a novel idea not to use in the uk but then we re not in a state of permanent paranoia like americans seem to be

gt albert as i ve told you before the first korean war was a response to north korean and then later chinese aggression against south korea by a united nations force not just the us acting unilaterally lt why not let the north koreans and their chinese ally take the whole of korea in after all they are all koreans and it would have saved millions of lives and today they would either be rapidly building themselves up after the collapse of communism like eastern europe or more likely since soviet communism has never got anything to do with it they would like china have adapted capitalist measures in recognition of this system un rivalled properties for development of nations and satisfying of their peoples while rsataining for some more years a formal communist leadership

hi speed sorry for not coming back to your comments earlier my day got busy i have mixed feelings about it vina yes so do i which is why i posted the question there are so many possibilities and different scenarios that i think we can only point at the most general and usual cases so i think that that is why the harrison ford case is not applicable to most people certainly this is millionaire celebrity and given his financial status as you said he will not be confronted with the typical cases of not being able to pay babysitting for the not so pleasant tasks j more time available for parenting etc perhaps in some ways even a better parent as they would have years more wisdom and life experience to pass along be more mature themselves than say a very young parent might be yes that may be a positive thing but also the bigger the generational gap the most difficult it may be to understand each other so i think that a given persons financial stability emmotional readiness maturity level and frame of time to actually spend with the child particularly during the early developemental years plays more of a significant role in what sort of parent they will make than does their age lets face it its just like that harry chapin song cats in the cradle i love that song by the time most kids are in their late teens and beyond they dont spend all that much time with their parents anyway true this is however more than not the rule of life but by the time children pass the teenage stage get into adulthood and most of all as they become parents themselves then they will start respecting their parents again and begin to understand in retrospect why their parents acted the way they did so parents now become the best friends allies and advisers this is the part that i see as downside when having children late in life now in the case of this woman in the article she had twins speed i can tell you how i was super handful with one so even as a young person i was exhausted all the time and the second baby came less than years after i know the same was for you so how this woman who naturally wont have all the energy of a person in her s or s will be able to cope with newborn twins or she may turn out to do better than all of us us
